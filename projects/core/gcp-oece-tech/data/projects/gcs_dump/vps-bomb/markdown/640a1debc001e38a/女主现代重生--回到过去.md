**Date:** 08-05-22 15:06

The woman’s eyes fluttered open, the familiar yet distant ceiling of her bedroom greeting her. A sigh escaped her lips, a mixture of relief and disbelief. She was back. Back in the past, in her own body, before everything went wrong. The year was, she vaguely recalled, 2007.

**Date:** 08-05-22 15:07

A sudden wave of dizziness washed over her, and she closed her eyes, trying to regain her bearings. The memories, sharp and painful, flooded her mind. The betrayal, the loss, the despair – it was all a jumbled mess, yet the core emotions remained vividly etched.

*   [Why regret it?]
*   [Why regret it?]
*   [What happened?]
*   [Why did they do this?]
*   [Why is this happening?]
*   [Why, why, why? Because of those who were greedy, they were the ones who did it.]
*   [What a miserable situation.]
*   [What are these things? Why are they here?]

She felt a phantom pain, a ghost of a memory. The life she had lived, the choices she had made, the people she had trusted – it was all a cruel joke.

**Date:** 08-05-22 15:08

The woman’s gaze drifted to the window, the sunlight streaming in painting stripes across the floor. She had eighteen years to live, to make different choices. The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying.

“What should I do?” she whispered to herself, the words catching in her throat.

She could feel the weight of the past pressing down on her, a heavy blanket threatening to suffocate her. But beneath the despair, a flicker of hope ignited. She had a second chance.

“What about it?” she mused. “What about all those regrets?”

She had to confront them, to understand them. She had to find a way to rewrite her destiny.

*   [What should I do?]
*   [What time is it?]

She sat up, the blankets falling away. The air was crisp, the silence profound. This was her chance. Her chance to reclaim what was lost, to find happiness, to live a life free from the shadows of her past.

“I won’t let them win,” she vowed, her voice gaining strength.

She swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet touching the cool wooden floor. The journey ahead would be arduous, but she was ready. She was ready to fight for a better future.

The woman’s eyes scanned the room, a sense of déjà vu washing over her. It was all so familiar, yet so different. The posters on the wall, the books scattered on the desk, the scent of her mother’s perfume lingering in the air – it was a symphony of memories, each note a bittersweet melody.

“How did this happen?” she wondered.

She recalled the events leading up to her death, the series of unfortunate circumstances that had led her to this point. It was a tale of ambition, greed, and betrayal.

*   [You know that too.]
*   [It’s time.]

She closed her eyes, the memories replaying in her mind. The faces of those who had wronged her, the laughter of her loved ones, the tears of her family – it was a tapestry of emotions, each thread woven with love and loss.

“I will not falter,” she promised herself.
