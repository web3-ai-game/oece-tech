This is followed by a discussion of differing interpretations of what constitutes a 'person's' life. The author then reflects on how they are perceived by others ('faking', 'being affected', 'complaining') and their feeling of being 'pushed forward' with an uncertain purpose. The text exhibits a strong repetitive pattern, particularly regarding the author's perception and their lack of agency/purpose."
