# 《七钟面之谜》

## 第一章 早起

那平易近人的年轻人，杰米·狄西加，每次两级阶梯地跑下“烟囱屋”的宽大楼梯，他下楼的速度如此急速，因而撞上了正端着二壶热咖啡穿过大厅的堂堂主仆崔威尔。由于崔威尔的镇定和敏捷，幸而没有造成任何灾难。

“对不起，”杰米道歉说，“对了，崔威尔，我是不是最后一个下来的？”

“不是，先生，卫德先生还没有下来。”

“好。”杰米说着走进早餐室里。

早餐室里只有女主人一个，她那谴责的眼光令杰米觉得好像看到摆在鱼贩平台上的死鳕鱼眼睛一样不舒服。真是见鬼了，为什么这个女人要拿这种眼光看他？在乡下屋子里过夜，准九点半下楼来，门都没有。或许，现在已经十一点过一刻，是太过分了一点，可是——

“恐怕我是晚了一点，库特夫人。你说什么？”

“噢，没关系。”库特夫人以忧郁的声音说。

事实上，早餐迟到的人令她非常担忧。在她婚后的前十个年头里，如果欧斯华·库特爵士（当时还没有头衔）的早餐比八点即使只晚了半分钟，也会令他大发雷霆。库特夫人已经被训练成把不准时看作是最不可饶恕的罪过。这个习惯已经牢牢养成。而且，她是个急性子的女人，她不由得自问这些不知早起的年轻人在这世界上能干出什么好事业。如同欧斯华爵士常常对记者还有其他人所说的：“我的成功完全归功于早起，以及规律、俭朴的生活习惯；”库特夫人是个身材高大，带有悲剧性美感的漂亮女人。她有一对忧伤的黑色大眼睛和一副深沉的嗓子。想找个模特儿画“为子女恸哭的雅各之妻”圣经画的艺术家，如果见到了库特夫人一定会高兴得大声欢呼。她去演歌剧一定也很出色，演一个饱受丈夫虐待的可怜妻子在冰天雪地里独自瞒珊走着。

她看起来如同深藏着某种深沉的忧伤，然而事实上，库特夫人生活中毫无忧伤可言，除了欧斯华爵士的平步青云，迈入成功之途。她年轻的时候，是个艳丽的女孩，深深爱上欧斯华·库特——她父亲五金店旁一家脚踏车店里胸怀大志的年轻男孩。他们非常幸福地生活在一起，先是住在只有一两个房间的屋子，然后是一幢小屋子。再后是一幢大一点的房子，房子越住越大，不过总是在“工厂”的附近，直到如今欧斯华爵士出人头地，不再跟他的“工厂”相依为命，租住全英格兰最大的最豪华的大宅第便成了他的乐趣。“烟囱屋”是个历史性的地方，向卡特汉伯爵租赁两年，令欧斯华爵士感到他已达到他野心的巅峰。

库特夫人可不怎么快乐。她是个孤独的女人。她早期婚姻生活的主要娱乐便是跟“女孩”谈话——甚至当“女孩”增加为三个时，库特夫人生活的主要消遣之道还是跟她的家仆聊天。如今，有了一群女仆，一个像大主教一般的主仆，凡个各有专司的仆役，一群忙碌的厨房和洗涤室女佣，一个脾气吓人的外籍厨师和一个走起路来飒飒作响的大块头女管家，库特夫人有如一个被放逐到荒岛上的人一般。

现在，她深深叹了一口气，从敞开的落地窗飘荡出去，这倒让杰米·狄西加大大松了一口气，马上自己动手再多吃一些腰子和熏肉，好充实一下体力。“库特夫人悲凄地在阳台上站了一会儿，然后鼓起勇气跟正以专横的眼光扫视着他所统治的领土的主园丁马克唐那谈话。马克唐那是主园丁之中的头子。他知道他的地位——统治别人的地位。而他的统治——专横霸道。

库特夫人紧张地向他走过去。

“早，马克唐那。”

“早，夫人。”

他的语气就像个主园丁——悲凄，却带着威严——就像葬礼上的帝王。

“我在想——不知道我们今晚可不可以摘下那边一些晚生的葡萄当点心？”

“它们还不够熟，不能摘。”马克唐那说。

他说来语气温和但却坚定。

“噢！”库特夫人说。

她鼓起勇气。

“噢！可是我昨天在那一头尝了一颗，好像很好吃嘛。”

马克唐那看着她，她脸红起来。他令她感到她自己那样做是放肆得不可饶恕。显然去世的卡特汉伯爵夫人从没这么失礼，自己跑进暖房里摘葡萄吃。

“如果你吩咐的话，夫人，会剪下一串送进去给你。”马克唐那尖刻地说。

“噢，谢谢你。”库特夫人说，“好，我下一次会这样做。”

“可是它们还不适合摘。”

“是的。”库特夫人喃喃说道，“是的，我想大概是还不适合。那么我们还是留着吧。”

马克唐那巧妙地保持沉默。库特夫人再度鼓起勇气：

“我正要跟你谈谈玫瑰花园后面的那块草坪。我不知道是不是可以用来作滚球场地。欧斯华爵士非常喜欢滚球游戏。”

“有什么不可以？”库特夫人自己心里想着。她上过英国历史课，书上不是说法兰西斯·狄瑞克爵士正和他的同伴一起玩滚球而西班牙来犯的无敌舰队已经举目可见了吗？这当然是马克唐那无法反对的一项绅士传统。然而她忽略了一个优秀的主园丁的显著特性，那就是反对任何别人向他提出的建议或意见。

“不能拿它作那个用途。”马克唐那不表同意地说。

他在话中加入了使人感到沮丧的意味，不过真正的用意是在引诱库特夫人进一步崩溃。

“如果清理一下，还有……呃……把……呃把那种东西全部砍掉。”她满怀希望地继续说着。

“行，”马克唐那慢吞吞地说，“那行得通。可是这样一来，就得把威廉从下花坛那里调上来。”

“噢！”库特夫人怀疑地说。他所谓的“下花坛”对她来说毫无意义——除了令她模糊地想起一首苏格兰歌名——但是显然这句话对马克唐那来说，是个不可克服的反对理由。

“那将是一大遗憾。”马克唐那说。

“噢！当然，”库特夫人说，“是的。”

然后怀疑为什么她会这么热切地同意。

马克唐那紧盯着她看。

“当然，”他说，“如果这是您的吩咐，夫人——”

他的话吊个尾巴。不过那怀有恶意的语气令库特夫人无法消受。她立即投降。

“噢！不，”她说，“我懂你的意思，马克唐那。不——不——威廉还是留在下花坛工作的好。”

“我自己正是这样认为，夫人。”

“是的，”库特夫人说，“是的，确实是。”

“我想你会同意，夫人。”马克唐那说。

“噢！确实。”库特夫人再度说。

马克唐那碰碰帽子，转身离去。

库特夫人闷闷不乐地叹了一口气，望着他的背影。杰米·狄西加饱食了腰子和熏肉，跨到阳台上，站在她一旁，以相当不同的态度叹了一声。

“一流的早晨，呃？”他喃喃地说道。

“是吗？”库特夫人心不在焉地说，“噢！是的，我想大概是吧。我没注意到。”

“其他人呢？在湖上划船？”

“我想是吧。我是说，我本怀疑他们是在那里。”

库特夫人<bos> turn around, and promptly rushed back into the house. Mr. Tuivel was inspecting the coffee pot.

“Oh dear,” said Mrs. Coot, “hasn’t that Mr—”

“Mr. Wade, madam?”

“Yes, Mr. Wade. Hasn’t he come down yet?”

“No, madam.”

“It’s very late.”

“It is very late, madam.”

“Oh dear. I suppose he will come down, Mr. Tuivel?”

“Oh, undoubtedly, madam; Mr. Wade came down at half-past eleven yesterday, madam.”

Mrs. Coot glanced at the clock, which was twenty minutes to twelve. A wave of sympathy passed over her.

“You are very unlucky, Mr. Tuivel, to have to clear away breakfast and lay lunch before one o’clock.”

“I am accustomed to the ways of young gentlemen, madam.”

The condemnation was delicately phrased, but none the less unmistakable. A cardinal might as well condemn a well-meaning Turk or a heathen for unintentional rudeness.

Mrs. Coot blushed for the second time that morning. An interruption occurred just in time to save her from further embarrassment. The door opened, and a young man with a serious, bespectacled face looked in.

“Oh! you are here, Mrs. Coot, Sir Oswald wants you.”

“Oh! I will go at once, Mr. Bateman.”

Mrs. Coot hurried out.

Sir Oswald’s private secretary, Mr. Rupert Bateman, went out by another path, and across the French window into the place where Mr. Jamie Dixy was still idling in a friendly manner.

“Hullo, Chimpanzee,” said Jamie, “I suppose I shall have to go and smile at the blessed girls. Are you coming?”

Mr. Bateman shook his head, and hurried along the balcony, and in through the library window.

Jamie grinned amicably after his retreating form. He and Mr. Bateman had been at the same school, when Mr. Bateman was a serious, bespectacled little boy, who had been nicknamed “Chimpanzee” for no earthly reason.

Chimpanzee, thought Jamie, was still as great a fool as ever. “Life is real, life is earnest” might have been written for him.

Jamie yawned, and strolled down to the lake. The girls were there, three of them – quite ordinary girls, two with dark hair, one with golden hair. The loudest giggle, he thought, belonged to Helen—

The other was Nancy—

The third, for some reason or other, was called “Socks.” With them were his two friends, Mr. Bill Avisley and Mr. Ronnie Devereux, both in the Diplomatic Service, for colour.

“Hi,” said Nancy (or possibly Helen), “it’s Jamie. What’s-his-name?”

“You don’t mean to say,” said Mr. Bill Avisley, “that Jerry Wade hasn’t got up yet? Something ought to be done about it.”

“If he isn’t careful,” said Mr. Ronnie Devereux, “he’ll miss his breakfast one of these days—he’ll only get lunch or tea when he rolls down.”

“It’s a shame,” said the girl they called Socks, “because it makes Mrs. Coot so worried. She’s getting more like a hen that wants to lay eggs and can’t. It’s dreadful.”

“Let’s go and pull him out of bed.” suggested Bill. “Come on, Jamie.”

“Oh! we’ll do it more subtly.” said the one called Socks. “Subtly” was a favourite word of hers. She used it a great deal.

“I’m not subtle,” said Jamie. “I don’t know how to be subtle.”

“We’ll do it collectively tomorrow morning,” ambiguously suggested Ronnie. “You know, waking him up at seven o’clock. Startle the whole house. Make Mr. Tuivel’s false beard and his teapot fall to the floor. Make Mrs. Coot have hysterics and swoon in Bill’s arms—Bill feeling like the Tower of Pisa. Sir Oswald says ‘Ha! his steel stocks have risen one and an eighth.’ Chimpanzee’s reaction would be to throw his spectacles on the ground and tread on them.”

“You don’t understand Jerry,” said Jamie. “I daresay enough cold water might wake him up—if applied judiciously. But he’d only turn over and go to sleep again.”

“Oh! we must think of something more subtle than cold water.” Socks said.

“Well, what?” asked Ronnie frankly, nobody having an answer ready.

“We ought to be able to think of something.” said Bill. “Who’s the cleverest?”

“Chimpanzee.” said Jamie. “Here he comes, rushing along as usual. Chimpanzee’s always the cleverest, that’s his misfortune since boyhood. Let him think of it,” Mr. Bateman listened patiently to their rather disconnected narratives. His expression was that of a man poised for flight. He did not waste time in articulating his solution.

“I suggest a clock.” he said briskly. “I use one myself, in case of oversleeping; I find that bringing in morning tea without a sound doesn’t always wake people up.”

He hurried away.

“A clock.” Ronnie shook his head. “A clock? To wake Jerry Wade, it would take about a dozen clocks.”

“And why not?” said Bill, blushing hotly, and looking eager. “I’ve thought of it. We’ll all go into town, and everyone buy a clock.” A burst of laughter and discussion. Bill and Ronnie went off to the motor-car. Jamie undertook to reconnoitre the dining-room, and returned presently.

“He’s in there all right. Guzzling toast and jam. How shall we prevent him from coming with us?”

It was finally decided to enlist Mrs. Coot’s services. Jamie, Nancy, and Helen went on the errand. Mrs. Coot looked bewildered.

“A joke? You’ll have to be careful, my dears. I mean, you won’t scratch the furniture or damage anything else, or use too much water. We have to give the house back to the owner next week, you know. I don’t want Lord Carterham to think—”

Bill, returning from the garage, interrupted her with an assurance.

“That’s all right, Mrs. Coot. Lady Fling-Flang – Lord Carterham’s daughter – is a great friend of mine. Besides, she isn’t particular about anything – not a bit! You can leave it to me. It won’t be damaged, anyway. It’s quite a mild affair.”

“Subtle.” said the girl called Socks.

Mrs. Coot walked sorrowfully along the balcony, and Jerry Wade emerged from the dining-room. Mr. Jamie Dixy was a fair, handsome young man, in comparison with whom Jerry Wade might be described as decidedly fairer and handsomer, and his bewildered expression made Jamie’s face look quite intelligent.

“Hullo, Mrs. Coot.” said Jerry Wade. “Where has everyone gone?”

“They’ve all gone into town.” said Mrs. Coot.

“To do what?”

“To have some sort of joke.” Mrs. Coot said in her low, sorrowful voice.

“It’s a little early to joke at this hour of the morning.” Mr. Wade said.

“It’s not early.” Mrs. Coot said pointedly.

“I’m afraid I’m a little late.” Mr. Wade said, attractively candid. “It’s a curious thing, but wherever I sleep I’m always the last to get up.”

“Very unusual.” said Mrs. Coot.

“I don’t know why it is.” Mr. Wade said reflectively. “I can’t imagine, I’m sure.”

“Why don’t you simply get up?” said Mrs. Coot.

“Oh!” said Mr. Wade. The simplicity of the solution surprised him slightly.

Mrs. Coot went on eagerly.

“I’ve often heard Sir Oswald say that there’s nothing like punctuality for making young men get on in the world.”

“Oh! I know.” Mr. Wade said. “I have to be punctual in town, I mean, I have to be at the Foreign Office by eleven. Don’t you think I’m a sluggard, Mrs. Coot. Ah, your front flowers are lovely, I forget the name, but we have some at home—those mauve ones. My sister is very keen on gardening.”

Mrs. Coot’s attention was immediately diverted. Her internal grievances pricked her.

“What sort of gardeners have you?”

“Oh! only one, rather an old fogey, I believe. Doesn’t know much, but does whatever you tell him. That’s a blessing, isn’t it?” Mrs. Coot agreed profoundly; she would have made a splendid actress in a melodrama. They fell to discussing the delinquencies of gardeners.

On the other hand, the expeditionary force was progressing most successfully. They stormed a large store in the town, and the bewildered proprietor was quite unable to understand why so many clocks were suddenly required.

“I wish Lady Fling-Flang were here,” muttered Bill. “You know her, Jamie? Oh! you’d like her, she’s a ripping girl – a real sport – and you remember, she’s awfully clever, you know, Ronnie?”

Ronnie shook his head.

“Don’t know Lady Fling-Flang? How do you get on? She’s ripping.”

“A little subtlety, Bill.” Socks said. “Don’t chatter about your girl friends, and get on with the job.”

Mr. Mogallo, the proprietor of Mogallo’s, said persuasively: “If you’ll allow me to suggest, ladies, I should say—don’t buy that. It’s a good clock—I’m not saying it isn’t, but I strongly recommend this make. It’s dearer but worth it, reliable. You know, I don’t want you to say afterwards—”

To everyone’s surprise, Mogallo stopped dead.

“We don’t want reliable clocks.” said Nancy.

“We want them to go for one day.” said Helen. “We don’t want subtle ones.” Socks said. “We want loud ones.”

“We want—” Bill stopped short, for Jamie, with a touch of mechanical genius, had wound and set several of the alarm clocks.

In five minutes the shop would be ringing with deafening alarms.

Six of the loudest were chosen finally.

“I’ll tell you what.” said Ronnie, smiling charmingly. “I’ll get Chimpanzee one. It was his idea, and it’s only fair he should have one. I’ll buy it for him.”

“Yes.” said Bill. “And I’ll get Mrs. Coot one, the more the merrier. She’s doing a difficult task, probably gossiping with Jerry now.”

Mrs. Coot was, as a matter of fact, engaged in giving Jerry an interminable account of a prize peach tree which Macdougal the gardener had grown.

The alarm clocks were wrapped up, and paid for. Mr. Mogallo watched the departing motor-car with bewilderment. These young people of the upper classes had a great deal of spirit, really a great deal of spirit, but they were not altogether comprehensible. He breathed a sigh of relief, and turned to attend to a clergyman’s wife who wished to purchase a new teapot.

## 第二章 闹钟

“Where shall we put them?”

Dinner was over. Mrs. Coot was once more assigned the task. Sir Oswald, as was to be expected, proposed bridge – proposed is the wrong word. Sir Oswald had become one of the leading figures in the film “Our Leading Industrialists” (Leader Number Seven in the first episode), and as soon as he expressed a preference, those about him hastened to obey.

Rupert Bateman and Oswald partnered Mrs. Coot and Jerry Wade, a arrangement which was most satisfactory. Sir Oswald played bridge admirably, and like everything else he did, liked to have a suitable partner; Bateman played bridge with the efficiency of a secretary. Both watched their cards intently, and bid with clipped, precise voices. “No trump, two diamonds,” “Double,” “Three spades,” Mrs. Coot and Jerry Wade looked languidly on, the young people not forgetting to say after every hand played by Mrs. Coot:

“Ah, partner, you played that magnificently.” The admiring tone gratified Mrs. Coot immensely. They held very good hands.

The others were supposed to be in the ballroom dancing to the wireless music. As a matter of fact, they were all collected outside Jerry Wade’s bedroom door, the air filled with suppressed giggles and the ticking of alarm clocks.

“Line them up under the bed.” Jamie answered Bill’s question.

“Then what time shall we set them for? I mean, what time shall they go off? All together, or at intervals?”

This point was hotly debated. One party maintained that for a sleeper like Jerry Wade, eight clocks ringing simultaneously would be necessary, the other preferring a gradual effect.

The latter argument eventually prevailed, and the clocks were set to ring one after another, commencing at half-past six in the morning.

“I hope,” said Bill, with canine purity, “that this will teach him a lesson.”

“Quite, quite!” said Socks.

As the business of hiding the clocks was about to commence, an alarm was sounded.

“Hush!” cried Jamie. “Someone’s coming upstairs.”

A panic ensued.

“It’s all right!” said Jamie. “Only Chimpanzee.”

Mr. Bateman, availing himself of a lull in the proceedings, was making his way towards his own room for a handkerchief. He paused halfway, glanced at them. Then he made a brief, practical remark.

“He’ll hear them ticking when he goes to bed.”

The conspirators exchanged glances.

“What did I tell you?” said Jamie, with sudden reverence. “Chimpanzee’s always the cleverest!”

The clever one went on his way.

“Yes,” said Ronnie Devereux, cocking his head, “eight clocks ringing simultaneously would be undeniably noisy. Even an old fool like Jerry couldn’t help hearing that, and would guess that somebody was playing a trick.”

“I wonder if he—” said Jamie Dixy.

“If what?”

“Is such a fool as we think him.”

Ronnie stared at him.

“We all think Jerry such a fool.”

“Do we?” said Jamie. “I sometimes think—Oh, nobody could possibly be such a fool as old Jerry.”

They all stared at him. Ronnie assumed a stern expression.

“Jamie!” he said. “You’ve got brains.”

“Second Chimpanzee,” added Bill effusively.

“Oh, I just happened to think it.” Jamie defended himself.

“Oh! Let’s not be subtle, all of us,” cried Socks. “What about the clocks?”

“Chimpanzee’s coming back. Let’s ask him.” suggested Jamie.

Chimpanzee, pressed for his decision, and after considerable cogitation, arrived at it. “When he’s asleep, go into his room quietly, and place the clocks on the floor.”

“Little Chimpanzee’s right again,” said Jamie. “At the word of command, everyone put down his clock, and we’ll go downstairs and wash our hands of the whole affair.”

The bridge game was still in progress—with a slight alteration in the personnel. Sir Oswald was now partnered with his wife, and was kindly pointing out her every mistake, Mrs. Coot accepting his strictures with cheerful docility. She did not, in fact, possess any real interest in the game. More than once she repeated:

“I understand, dear, thank you for telling me,” and continued to make the same mistake.

Jerry Wade from time to time remarked to Chimpanzee:

“Well played, partner, most magnificently played.”

Bill Avisley was timing himself with Ronnie Devereux.

“Suppose he goes to bed at twelve—what time do you think we ought to give him—say an hour?”

He yawned.

“Funny—I usually don’t feel sleepy till three in the morning, but tonight, just because I know we’re going to sit up, I feel inclined to be good, and go to bed at once. Everyone said they felt the same.”

“My dear Maria,” said Sir Oswald loudly, with a touch of indignation, “I have told you repeatedly, whether you ought to revoke or not, don’t hesitate. If you do, the whole table knows.”

Mrs. Coot had a perfectly good answer to this – namely, that as Sir Oswald was the dealer, he had no right to comment. She did not, however, articulate it. She merely smiled sweetly, leaned her considerable bosom across the table, and scrutinized Mr. Wade’s hand on her right.

Her anxiety subsided when she found he held the queen. She played the jack, revoked successfully, and laid down her hand.

“Fourteen tricks and the rubber,” she declared. “I think I’m awfully lucky to have made my bid.”

“Lucky.” murmured Jerry Wade. He pushed back his chair, and went over to join the others by the fireplace. “Lucky, she calls it. That woman wants watching.”

Mrs. Coot was collecting the paper money and silver.

“I know I don’t play well.” she said with unconcealed delight. “But I’m awfully lucky when I do play.”

“You’ll never be a bridge player, Maria,” said Sir Oswald.

“Yes, dear,” said Mrs. Coot, “I know I shan’t. You always tell me so, and I try so hard.”

“She does try,” Jerry murmured. “It’s impossible to disguise that. If she can’t see your hand any other way, she just puts her head over your shoulder.”

“I know you try,” said Sir Oswald. “It’s simply that you’ve no head for bridge.”

“I know, dear,” said Mrs. Coot. “You always tell me so. You owe me ten shillings, Oswald.”

“Do I?” Sir Oswald looked surprised.

“Yes. One thousand seven hundred points—eight pounds ten shillings. You’ve only given me eight pounds.”

“Ah, well,” said Sir Oswald. “My mistake.”

Mrs. Coot smiled wanly at him, and took the ten-shilling note. She was very fond of her husband, but she had no intention of being swindled out of ten shillings.

Sir Oswald went to a table and began vigorously mixing whiskies and sodas. At half-past twelve, everyone said good-night.

Ronnie Devereux, who occupied the room next to Jerry Wade, was appointed the duty of supervising the operation. At a quarter past two, he tiptoed out and knocked on everyone’s door, and the party assembled in their pyjamas and dressing-gowns, making various rustling, giggling, and whispering sounds.

“His light went out about twenty minutes ago,” Ronnie reported in a husky whisper. “I thought he’d never go to bed. I’ve just opened the door and peeped in, and he seems to be fast asleep. What’s the plan?”

The alarm clocks were brought out again. Here arose another problem.

“We can’t all squeeze in. There’s no room to stand. One person has to go in, and the others hand him the contraptions.”

Then there was a hot discussion as to who should be chosen.

The three girls were vetoed on the grounds of their tendency to giggle. Bill Avisley was vetoed on the grounds of his height, his weight, his heavy tread, and his clumsiness (which he strenuously denied). Jamie Dixy and Ronnie Devereux were put into consideration, but eventually the majority decided in favour of Mr. Rupert Bateman.

“Chimpanzee’s the fellow.” Jamie agreed. “He walks like a cat, anyhow—always has. Besides, if Jerry wakes up, Chimpanzee can think of something to say to him. You know, something reasonable, that will quiet him and put him off his guard.”

“Something subtle.” The girl called Socks thoughtfully suggested.

“Precisely.” said Jamie.

Chimpanzee went about his business with promptitude, carefully opening the bedroom door, and disappearing into the darkness within with the two largest alarm clocks. After a minute or two he reappeared on the threshold, and the other two clocks were handed to him, and he disappeared again twice more. Finally he emerged. Everyone held their breath, and listened intently. Jerry Wade’s rhythmic breathing could still be heard, but it seemed muffled and heavy, drowned by the clamorous ticking of Mr. Mogallo’s eight alarm clocks.

## 第三章 失败的玩笑

“Twelve o’clock!” cried Socks despairingly.

The joke—if it were to be considered a joke—was not proving particularly successful. On the other hand, the clocks had done their duty. They had rung one after another on time—with tremendous effect, shaking Ronnie Devereux out of bed in a dazed condition, and making him believe that the Day of Judgment had arrived. If the effect was such on the neighbouring room, what must it have been in the vicinity? Ronnie hurried out into the corridor, and pressed his ear against the crack of the door.

He expected to hear curses from within—he confidently expected them. But he heard nothing. That is to say, he heard nothing that he expected. All the clocks were still going merrily—ticking loudly, angrily. Then another clock rang, hoarsely, deafeningly, so that even a deaf man would have been enraged.

Undoubtedly the clocks had faithfully performed their duty. Their effect had surpassed Mr. Mogallo’s claims. But they had evidently met their match in Jerry Wade.

The entire party looked crestfallen.

“The fellow’s inhuman!” grumbled Jamie Dixy.

“Perhaps he thought it was the telephone ringing in the distance, and turned over and went to sleep again.”

Helen suggested (or possibly Nancy).

“I think it’s astonishing,” said Rupert Bateman solemnly. “I think he ought to see a doctor.”

“Some form of ear disease.” Bill hopefully suggested.

“Oh, if you ask me,” said Socks, “I think he’s only fooling us. Of course they woke him up. But he only wants to pretend he didn’t hear anything, to disappoint us.”

Everyone looked at Socks with reverence and admiration.

“That’s one way of looking at it.” said Bill.

“He’s subtle, that’s all,” said Socks. “You mark my words, he’ll get up late breakfast today—just to show us.”

As the hands of the clock pointed to a few minutes past twelve, everyone agreed that Socks’s theory was correct. Only Ronnie Devereux ventured an objection. “You’ve forgotten, Jamie, when the first clock rang, I was outside the door, and whatever Jerry decided afterwards, the first one must have startled him. He must have said something. What did you put the first clock near, Chimpanzee?”

“On a small table near his ear.” Mr. Bateman said.

“You think of everything, Chimpanzee.” Ronnie said. He turned to Bill. “If a tremendous bell rings within a few inches of your ear at half-past six in the morning, what do you say?”

“Oh! my God,” said Bill. “I should say—” he stopped.

“Of course you would,” said Ronnie. “So should I. Everyone would. Any normal person would jump up. Yet he didn’t. So I say, Chimpanzee’s right, as usual—Jerry’s ears are probably defective.”

“It’s twenty past twelve now.” said another girl mournfully.

“I think,” said Jamie slowly, “it’s a little much, isn’t it? I mean, jokes are jokes. But this is a little too much. It’s hardly fair to the Coot couple.”

Bill stared at him.

“What do you mean?”

“Oh,” said Jamie, “I don’t know why—it’s not like Jerry.”

He found it difficult to express his thought. He didn’t want to say more, and yet— He saw Ronnie watching him. Ronnie suddenly became alert.

Just then, Mr. Tuivel entered the room, looking round uncertainly.

“I thought Mr. Bateman was here.” he explained apologetically.

“Just went out of that French window.” said Ronnie. “Can I be of any assistance?”

Mr. Tuivel’s gaze travelled from him to Jamie Dixy, and back again to him. As if singled out, the two young men left the room with him. Mr. Tuivel carefully closed the door of the dining-room.

“Oh,” said Ronnie, “what is it?”

“Mr. Wade hasn’t come down, sir, and I took the liberty of sending Williams up to his room.”

“And?”

“Williams has just come down in a great state of agitation, sir.” Mr. Tuivel paused— paused preparatory to something. “Sir, I’m afraid the poor young gentleman must have died in his sleep.”

Jamie and Ronnie stared at him.

“Nonsense!” cried Ronnie finally. “That—that can’t be. Jerry—” His face changed suddenly. “I—I’ll go up and see. That fool Williams must be mistaken.”

Mr. Tuivel held up a hand to stop him. With a strange, uncomfortable detachment, Jamie realised that the butler knew everything.

“No, sir, Williams is not mistaken. I have sent for Dr. Carew, and taken the liberty of locking the door, and intend to inform Sir Oswald of the matter. Now I must find Mr. Bateman.”

Mr. Tuivel hurried away. Ronnie stood like a statue.

“Jerry.” he murmured.

Jamie linked his arm through his friend’s, and conducted him through a side door on to the balcony in a retired place, and pushed him into a chair.

“Take it easy, old boy,” he said kindly. “You’ll be able to breathe in a moment.”

He looked at him, however, with a slightly curious expression. He had not supposed Ronnie to be on such intimate terms with Jerry Wade.

“Poor Jerry,” he said thoughtfully. “Such a healthy young man.”

Ronnie nodded.

“Now I think of it, that clock business was rather beastly.” Jamie continued. “Funny, isn’t it, how a farce can sometimes be so like a tragedy?”

He spoke vaguely, allowing Ronnie time to recover. The other moved uneasily.

“I wish the doctor would come. I want to know—”

“Know what?”

“How—how he died.”

Jamie pursed his lips.

“Heart disease?” he hazarded.

Ronnie gave a short, dry laugh.

“I say, Ronnie.” said Jamie.

“Well?”

Jamie found it difficult to proceed. “You don’t mean—you don’t mean to suggest—I mean, you don’t suppose he was struck on the head or anything? Mr. Tuivel locked the door and all that.”

Jamie thought his words ought to elicit a reply, but Ronnie continued to stare straight before him, unresponsive.

Jamie shook his head, and relapsed into silence. He didn’t know what else to do but wait. So he waited.

Mr. Tuivel interrupted them.

“The doctor wants to see you both in the library, gentlemen.”

Ronnie sprang from his chair. Jamie followed him.

Dr. Carew was a vigorous young man, lean and tall, with an intelligent face. He nodded slightly as they greeted him. Chimpanzee looked more serious than usual, and made the introductions.

“You were a great friend of Mr. Wade’s, I understand.” the doctor said to Ronnie.

“His greatest friend.”

“Um. Well, it seems straightforward enough. Tragic, of course. He looked a healthy young man. Do you know if he had any habit of taking drugs to help him sleep?”

“To help him sleep?” Ronnie’s eyes widened. “He always slept like a log.”

“You never heard him complain of sleeplessness?”

“Never.”

“Oh, it’s quite simple, really. However, I’m afraid there will have to be an inquest.”

“How did he die?”

“Nothing to suspect, I think. Chloral overdose. The drug was beside his bed, and a glass. Very sad, these things.”

Jamie asked the question that trembled on his lips but could not get out, on behalf of his friend.

“Was there nothing—um—suspicious?”

The doctor shot him a sharp glance.

“Why do you say that? Is there any reason for suspicion?”

Jamie looked at Ronnie. If Ronnie knew anything, now was the time to say it. But to his astonishment, Ronnie shook his head.

“No reason whatever.” he said distinctly.

“Then it was suicide—ah?”

“Certainly not.”

Ronnie said, with finality. The doctor looked unconvinced.

“Nothing to your knowledge to cause him trouble? Money trouble? Women?”

Ronnie shook his head again.

“About his relatives. They will have to be communicated with.”

“He had a sister—a half-sister. Lives down at the Little Cloister, about twenty miles from here. Jerry used to stay with her when he wasn’t in town.”

“Um,” said the doctor, “er, she’ll have to be told.”

“I’ll go,” said Ronnie. “It’s not a nice job, but someone has to do it.” He looked at Jamie. “You know her, don’t you?”

“Slightly. I danced with her once or twice.”

“Then we’ll go in your car. You don’t mind? I couldn’t face that sort of thing alone.”

“Not at all,” Jamie assured him. “I was going to suggest it myself. I’ll get my old bus started.” He was glad to have something to do. Ronnie’s attitude puzzled him. Did he know or suspect anything? Why didn’t he tell the doctor?

Then the two friends got into Jamie’s car and drove off, happy to be dispensed with any speed limits.

“Jamie,” Ronnie said finally, “I think you’re probably my best pal—now.”

“Eh,” said Jamie. “How’s that?”

He said gruffly:

“There’s a thing I want to tell you. Something you ought to know.”

“About Jerry Wade?”

“Yes, about Jerry Wade.”

Jamie waited.

“Well?” he asked at last.

“I don’t know if I ought to tell you.” Ronnie said.

“Why not?”

“I promised not to.”

“Oh! Then perhaps you’d better not.”

There was a silence.

“But, I think—you know, Jamie, you’ve got more brains than I have.”

“That’s obvious.” Jamie said unceremoniously.

“No, I can’t say it.” Ronnie suddenly announced.

“All right,” said Jamie. “Suit yourself.”

After a long silence, Ronnie said: “What’s she like?”

“Who?”

“This girl, Jerry’s sister.”

Jamie was silent for a few minutes, then said in an altered tone:

“She’s all right. Really—er—she’s a very good sort.”

“Jerry was very fond of her, I know. He used to talk about her a lot.”

“She was very fond of Jerry. This—this will be a great blow to her.”

“Yes, nasty business.”

They went on in silence until they arrived at the Little Cloister.

The maid told them that Miss Rowley was in the garden. Unless they wished to see Mrs. Cooke—

Jamie said, persuasively, that they did not wish to see Mrs. Cooke.

“Who’s Mrs. Cooke?” Ronnie asked as they made their way into the somewhat neglected garden.

“An old trout who lives with Rowley.”

They trod on a stone path. At the end of the path was a girl and two black spaniels. A small girl, with very white skin, wearing a loose old tweed suit. Not at all the girl Ronnie had expected. In fact, not at all the type Jamie usually favoured.

She held the collar of one dog, and came to meet them.

“Hullo!” she said. “Don’t mind Elizabeth. She’s just had puppies, and is very suspicious.”

Her manner was exceedingly natural, and as she looked up and smiled faintly, the pink deepened on her cheeks. Her eyes were a very deep blue—like cornflowers.

Her eyes suddenly widened—was it apprehension? As though she had guessed their errand.

Jamie hurried to speak.

“Miss Wade, this is Mr. Ronnie Devereux. Jerry must have spoken of him often.”

“Oh! yes.” she turned, giving him a warm, charming smile. “You’re both staying at Chimneys, aren’t you? Why didn’t you bring Jerry with you?”

“We—er—couldn’t.” Ronnie said, stopping short.

Jamie again perceived the look of alarm in her eyes.

“Miss Wade,” he said, “I’m afraid—I mean, we have bad news for you.”

She grew suddenly tense.

“Jerry?”

“Yes—Jerry. He—"

She suddenly stamped her foot excitedly.

“Oh! tell me—tell me—” she turned suddenly to Ronnie. “You tell me.”

Jamie felt a pang of jealousy, as he knew now what he had till now hesitated to admit: why Helen, Nancy, and Socks were merely “girls” to him.

He only half heard Ronnie’s solemn voice saying:

“Well, Miss Wade, I’m telling you—Jerry’s dead.”

She took the news with great courage. Her mouth opened, she gasped, and took a step backwards, but after a minute or two, she eagerly asked all the questions—how he died? when?

Ronnie told her as gently as possible.

“Sleeping draught? Jerry?”

Her tone of disbelief was palpable. Jamie looked at her with almost a warning glance. He suddenly felt that innocent Miss Rowley might say a great deal.

It was his turn to explain as gently as possible that an inquest would be necessary, and she shivered. She declined their invitation to return with them to Chimneys, but explained that she would follow later. She had her own two-seater motor-car.

“But I think—” she said piously. “I think I’ll be alone for a little while.”

“I understand.” said Ronnie.

“It’s all right.” said Jamie.

They watched her, feeling helpless and bewildered.

“Thank you both for coming.”

They drove back in silence, a certain awkwardness between them.

“Good heavens! what courage that girl has.” said Ronnie. Jamie agreed.

“Jerry was my friend,” Ronnie continued. “I must look after her a bit.”

“Oh! yes, of course.”

They spoke no more.

On returning to Chimneys, Jamie was intercepted by Mrs. Coot, who was in tears.

“The poor child,” she repeated again and again. “The poor child.” Jamie tried to think of suitable words to say.

Mrs. Coot launched into a long account of the deaths of some dear friends of hers. Jamie listened sympathetically, and eventually managed to disengage himself without any great discourtesy.

He ran upstairs lightly. Ronnie was just emerging from Jerry Wade’s room. He seemed surprised to see Jamie.

“I’ve just been in to see him,” he said. “Are you going in?”

“I think I won’t.” said Jamie. He was a healthy young man, and instinctively disliked seeing anything that reminded him of death.

“I think all his friends ought to go and see him.”

“Oh! do you think so?” said Jamie, thinking as he said it, that Ronnie Devereux was very odd about the whole affair.

“Yes. It’s a mark of respect.”

Jamie sighed, and capitulated.

“Oh! all right,” he said, squaring his shoulders slightly, and went in.

The sheet was strewn with white flowers, and the room was tidy and orderly.

Jamie cast a quick, nervous glance at the still white face. Could that be the rosy, handsome Jerry Wade? That motionless form. He shivered.

As he turned to leave the room, his eyes swept over the mantelpiece, and he stopped in astonishment. The alarm clocks were arranged in a neat row.

He strode out abruptly, and Ronnie was waiting for him.

“He looks very peaceful. Such rotten luck.” Jamie murmured.

Then he said:

“By the way, Ronnie, who put those clocks on the mantelpiece like that?”

“How do I know? Probably the servants, I expect.”

“It’s queer, though,” said Jamie, “there are only seven, not eight. One’s missing. Did you notice?”

Ronnie grunted vaguely.

“Seven instead of eight,” Jamie frowned. “I wonder why.”

## 第四章 一封信

“Don’t think of others, I say that’s what’s the matter.” said Lord Carterham.

His voice was gentle and sorrowful, as if pleased with the adjective he had found for himself.

“Yes, really doesn’t think of others. I have always found that these men who have made their own way in the world are none of them thinkers of others. It is very likely the reason why they have managed to accumulate so much wealth.”

He gazed mournfully at his ancestral home, which he had repossessed that day.

His daughter, Miss Irene Cantabrian—known to her friends and society generally as “Fling-Flang”—laughed.

“You have certainly accumulated a great deal of wealth,” she said coolly. “Although you’re not bad, this place has cost old Coot a pretty penny. What sort of a man is he? Presentable, I suppose?”

“A big man,” said Lord Carterham, with a slight shudder. “A red, square face, iron-grey hair. Strong, you know. What they call a man of strong character, if steam-rollers could become persons, he would be one.”

“Rather dull?” suggested Fling-Flang sympathetically.

“Terribly dull, filled with the most depressing virtues, such as moderation and punctuality. I don’t know which sort of man is the worst, the man of strong character or the earnest politician. I would rather have the pleasant incompetent any day.”

“The pleasant incompetent would not be able to pay the rent of this gloomy old house,” reminded Fling-Flang.

Lord Carterham winced.

“I wish you wouldn’t use such words, Fling-Flang. We are to talk of that topic.”

“I don’t see why you’re so sensitive about it,” said Fling-Flang. “After all, people do die in houses.”

“It’s not necessary that they should die in my house.” Lord Carterham said.

“I don’t see why not. Lots of people have died here. A whole host of old great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers and so on.”

“That’s different,” said Lord Carterham. “Of course I’d expect the Cantabrian family to die here—they don’t count. But I really do object to strangers dying here. And I object particularly to inquests. They soon become a habit. This is the second time. You remember that dreadful business four years ago? That was entirely the fault of George Rumaux, by the way.”

“And now you’re blaming poor old Coot the steam-roller. I’m sure he’s as unhappy about it as anyone.”

“Thinks nothing of others,” Lord Carterham insisted obstinately. “It is probably not wise to invite people like that here for a holiday. Say what you will, Fling-Flang, I don’t like inquests. I have never been to one, and I never shall attend a holiday.”

“Oh, this time it’s not the same as last time,” Fling-Flang reassured him. “I mean, it’s not murder.”

“It might be—judging by the way the stupid inspector makes a fuss about it. He hasn’t got over that business of four years ago yet. He thinks every death that occurs here must be a dirty plot of serious political significance. You have no idea how he fusses; I heard from Mr. Tuivel that he tested everything for fingerprints. Of course they only found the dead man’s own fingerprints. The clearest case possible—though whether it was suicide or accident is another matter.”

“I met Jerry Wade once,” said Fling-Flang. “He was a friend of Bill’s. You’d have liked him, Father. I never met anyone who was more of a pleasant incompetent.”

“I don’t like people who come and die in my house on purpose to annoy me.” Lord Carterham insisted obstinately.

“But I really can’t imagine anyone murdering him.” Fling-Flang continued. “The idea is absurd.”

“Of course it is,” Lord Carterham said. “Or rather, it would be absurd to anyone except a fool like Inspector Rumaux.”

“Perhaps fingerprinting makes him feel important,” Fling-Flang reassured him. “In any case, they call it ‘accidental death,’ don’t they?”

Lord Carterham reluctantly agreed.

“They’ll have to consider the feelings of the sister.”

“Has he a sister? I didn’t know.”

“A half-sister, I believe. Much younger. Old Wade ran away with her mother—he always did that sort of thing. No woman contented him except one who belonged to another man.”

“I’m very glad you’ve kept that habit to yourself.” said Fling-Flang.

“I have led a very respectable and pious life,” Lord Carterham said. “And considering how little harm I have done to anyone, it is curious how I cannot get peace. If—”

He stopped, seeing Fling-Flang step out of the French window.

“Macdougal!” Fling-Flang called in a clear, imperious voice.

The king has arrived. His face might have worn a welcoming smile, but the inherent gloom of a gardener dispelled it.

“Miss?” said Macdougal.

“How do you do?” said Fling-Flang.

“I am well.” said Macdougal.

“I wanted to talk to you about the rolling lawn. It’s getting too long and untidy. Get someone to attend to it, will you?”

Macdougal hesitated, and shook his head.

“That means taking William away from the flower beds, miss.”

“To hell with his flower beds,” said Fling-Flang. “Make him attend to it at once. And, Macdougal—”

“Yes, miss?”

“Pick some of those grapes over there. I know it’s the wrong time, and it’s always the wrong time, but I want them picked. Understand?”

Fling-Flang returned to the library.

“I’m sorry, Father,” she said. “I think I caught Macdougal. Were you saying something?”

“I was saying nothing,” Lord Carterham said. “But it doesn’t matter. What were you saying to Macdougal?”

“Trying to cure him of his conceit. But it’s impossible. I don’t suppose the Coot couple will get on his good side. Macdougal won’t like the whistle of the steam-roller Coot. What sort of woman is Mrs. Coot?”

Lord Carterham considered the question.

“She’s rather like Mrs. Sedgewick, in my opinion.” he finally said. “I fancy she’s quite keen on amateur theatricals. I should think this business with the alarm clocks must have distressed her very much.”

“What alarm clocks?”

“Tuivel was telling me just now, it seems a party of people staying here had a joke. They bought a lot of clocks, and hid them in the room of this young Mr. Wade. And then, of course, the poor fellow died. It makes the whole thing rather unpleasant.”

Fling-Flang nodded.

“Tuivel also told me some other peculiar things about the clocks,” Lord Carterham continued, now quite amused. “It appears that someone collected them, and lined them up on the mantelpiece after the poor fellow died.”

“Oh, and why not?” said Fling-Flang.

“I don’t see why not myself,” said Lord Carterham. “But apparently it caused a great deal of consternation. Nobody admitted doing it, you know. All the servants were questioned, and swore they hadn’t touched the horrid things. It’s a mystery, really. Afterwards the coroner, when questioned at the inquest, you know how difficult it is to explain things to that class of person.”

“Utter lack of breeding.” said Fling-Flang.

“Of course,” Lord Carterham said. “It’s difficult to know what happened afterwards. I didn’t understand half of what Tuivel told me. By the way, Fling-Flang, that fellow died in your room.”

Fling-Flang made a wry face.

“Why should anyone die in my room?” she asked indignantly.

“That’s just what I’ve been saying,” Lord Carterham said triumphantly. “Doesn’t think of others. Everyone nowadays ought to die, but not think of others.”

“I don’t care about that,” Fling-Flang said bravely. “Why should I care?”

“I do,” she said. “I do care very much. I should dream, you know—dream of ghosts and chains.”

“Oh,” said Fling-Flang, “Auntie Cecily died in your bed. I don’t suppose you see her ghost wandering about your bed.”

“I do sometimes,” said Lord Carterham, shuddering. “Especially after lobster.”

“Oh, thank God I’m not superstitious.” said Fling-Flang.

However, that evening, she sat in her dressing-gown before the fire in her bedroom. To her surprise, her thoughts returned to that pleasant, bewildered young man Jerry Wade. It was difficult to believe that such a joyous young man could have committed suicide intentionally. No, another explanation must be the correct one. He had taken a sleeping draught, and made a mistake, taken too much. That was possible. She did not flatter herself that Jerry Wade had died from excessive worry.

Her gaze drifted to the mantelpiece, and she began to think about the alarm clocks.

Her maid, having listened to the various narratives of the housemaids, had told her all about it. She had added some details which Tuivel apparently considered unworthy of mention to Lord Carterham, but which aroused Fling-Flang’s curiosity. Seven alarm clocks had been neatly arranged on the mantelpiece; the remaining one had been found on the lawn outside, apparently thrown from the window.

Fling-Flang was now thinking perplexedly about this. It seemed such a strange, purposeless thing to do. She could imagine a housemaid tidying the clocks and denying it when questioned. But of course no housemaid would throw a clock into the garden. Was it Jerry who had thrown it out when the first clock had woken him? No! That was impossible too, Fling-Flang remembered hearing that he had died early in the morning, and must have been in a comatose state for some time before his death.

Fling-Flang frowned. The matter of the clocks was indeed peculiar. She must go and see Bill Avisley. He had been here at the time, she knew.

Fling-Flang was not a girl to procrastinate. She stood up and went to her writing-desk. It was an inlaid desk, with a roll-top that slid back. Fling-Flang sat down. She drew out a paper, and began to write.

My dear Bill—

She paused, and pulled at the bottom of the desk. It stuck, as it always did. Fling-Flang pulled impatiently, but it would not move. She remembered once when an envelope had been pushed in with it, and it had stuck. She took a thin paper-knife, and inserted it into the slit. Her efforts were successful, and a corner of white paper protruded; Fling-Flang seized the corner, and pulled it out. It was the first page of a letter, slightly crumpled.

The date on the letter attracted Fling-Flang’s attention. The large date stood out from the page. September 21st.

“September 21st,” Fling-Flang said slowly. “Ah, of course that was—"

She interrupted herself. Yes, she was sure. The 22nd was the day Jerry Wade’s body was discovered. This must, therefore, be a letter written by him on the evening of the tragedy.

Fling-Flang flattened the letter, and began to read. It was unfinished.

My dear Rowley, I am coming to see you on Wednesday. I feel perfectly strong, and in very good spirits. It will be a great pleasure to see you. Listen, you must forget all about the “Seven Dials” that I told you. I thought it was more or less a joke, but it is not—not at all, and I am very sorry I ever mentioned it—it is not a thing for children like you to be mixed up in. So forget it, will you? I have other things to tell you—but I am so sleepy, my eyes are almost closing. Oh, about the hounds; I think—

The letter ended there.

Fling-Flang sat, frowning. What were the “Seven Dials”? Some low quarter of London, she thought. The words “Seven Dials” reminded her of something, but she couldn’t think what. Her attention reverted to two sentences: “I feel perfectly strong” and “I am so sleepy, my eyes are almost closing.” This did not fit. This did not fit at all. For on that very evening Jerry had taken a large dose of chloral, and had never woken up. If he wrote truthfully in his letter, why had he taken a sleeping draught?

Fling-Flang shook her head. She looked round the room, and shuddered slightly. If Jerry were looking at her now, in this very room where he had died... She sat motionless. Except for the ticking of her golden clock, there was silence. The ticking sounded unnaturally loud.

Fling-Flang’s eyes swept over the mantelpiece. A vivid picture rose in her mind. The dead man lying in bed, the seven alarm clocks ticking on the mantelpiece—ticking loudly, ominously…… Tick…… Tock…… Tick!

## 第五章 马路上的男人

“Father!” Fling-Flang opened the door of Lord Carterham’s private sanctuary and looked in. “I’m going into town in my Spanish car. I can’t stand the monotony of this place any longer.”

“We only got back yesterday.” Lord Carterham complained.

“I know. It feels like a hundred years. How dreadfully dull the country is!”

“I disagree with you,” said Lord Carterham. “It is peaceful, undoubtedly—peaceful, and most comfortable. I cannot tell you how glad I am to have Mr. Tuivel to attend to me. He thinks of my comfort most minutely. Someone came this morning asking if they could hold a Girl Guide rally here, which put me in a very awkward position—having to refuse—though perhaps I ought not to have refused. But Mr. Tuivel relieved me of my difficulty. I forget what he said—something exceedingly clever, that hurt no one’s feelings and put the other person entirely off the idea.”

“Comfort is not enough for me,” said Fling-Flang. “I require excitement.”

Lord Carterham shuddered.

“Haven’t we had enough excitement four years ago?” he asked mournfully.

“I shall find some more excitement,” said Fling-Flang. “Not that I expect to find it in town. But, in any case, I don’t want to yawn my head off here.”

“In my experience,” said Lord Carterham, “people who go looking for trouble usually find it.” He yawned, and added, “However, I personally don’t mind going up to town.”

“Well, let’s go,” said Fling-Flang. “But make it quick, as I’m in a hurry.”

Lord Carterham, who was just getting up, paused.

“You’re in a hurry?” he asked suspiciously.

“Terribly!” said Fling-Flang.

“Then I shan’t go. To sit in your Spanish car when you’re in a hurry—no, that’s not fair to an old man. I shall stay here.”

“As you wish,” said Fling-Flang, turning away.

Mr. Tuivel arrived.

“Your Lordship, the vicar is most anxious to see you, the Boys’ Brigade business has unfortunately given rise to a dispute.”

Lord Carterham grunted.

“My Lord, I thought I heard you say at luncheon that you would walk over to the vicar this morning to discuss the matter.”

“You told him that?” Lord Carterham asked eagerly.

“I did, my Lord. He left as though his legs were on fire, if you’ll forgive my saying so. I hope I was right, my Lord?”

“Of course you were right, Mr. Tuivel. You are always right, provided you do your best not to be wrong.”

Mr. Tuivel smiled sweetly and retired.

Meanwhile, Fling-Flang was impatiently sounding the motor-horn in front of the great iron gates. A little girl rushed out of the gate-house, and her mother, calling after her, shouted: “Careful of the car, Kitty! That Miss Cantabrian is in a hurry, as usual.”

Fling-Flang’s temperament was indeed hurried, especially when driving. She had skill and daring, and was an expert driver; otherwise, at her reckless pace, goodness knew what might have happened.

It was a crisp October morning, with a blue sky and a dazzling sun. The air was scented, and Fling-Flang’s cheeks were flushed, full of vitality. She had posted Jerry Wade’s unfinished letter to Miss Rowley Wade at Little Cloister, with a few explanatory remarks. The odd impression made by the letter had been somewhat blurred by daylight, but it still left her with the feeling that it required explanation. She intended to ask Bill Avisley about it sometime, and get him to give her a more detailed account of the party that had ended so tragically. It was a lovely morning, she felt particularly comfortable, and the Spanish import sped along.

Fling-Flang put on speed, and the car responded immediately. Mile after mile passed, the traffic lights were few and far between, and Fling-Flang drove with complete contentment.

Then, without warning, a man staggered out of the hedge and into the road, directly in front of the car. It was impossible to brake in time. Fling-Flang put all her strength into twisting the steering-wheel, and the car swerved out of the right-hand track, and nearly fell into the ditch—almost. It was a dangerous manoeuvre, but successful.

Fling-Flang felt quite sure she had missed the man.

Fling-Flang jumped out of the car and ran back. She had never run over anything more important than a stray hen. She did not think at the moment of the car accident being almost her fault. The man seemed drunk, but whether drunk or not, she had run him down, she was quite sure she had run him down. Her heart thumped, and she felt sick.

She knelt beside the prostrate figure, and carefully turned him over.

He did not moan or cry out. She saw he was a young man, a rather good-looking young man, elegantly dressed, with a toothbrush moustache.

She could see no external injury, but she was quite sure he was either dead or dying. His eyes were half-open, his eyelids twitching. Pitiful eyes, brown, suffering eyes, like a dog’s eyes. He seemed to be struggling to speak. Fling-Flang put her ear close.

“What,” she asked, “what?”

He wanted to say something, she could see that, desperately wanted to say it. And she could not help him, could do nothing.

At last, the words came, like puffs of breath:

“Seven Dials…… tell……”

“What?” Fling-Flang asked again. He was trying to say a name—with all his remaining strength trying to say: “Who am I to tell?” “Tell… Jamie Dixy…” he finally said, and then his head fell back, and his body went limp.

Fling-Flang sank on the ground, trembling from head to foot. She had never imagined anything so terrible could happen to her. He was dead—she had killed him.

She did her best to pull herself together. What was she to do now? The doctor—that was the first thought. Perhaps—just perhaps—the man was only unconscious, not dead. Her intuition told her this was impossible. But she forced herself to act. Somehow, she must get him into the car, and take him to the nearest doctor’s house. It was a remote country road, and there was no one to help her.

Fling-Flang, though slight in appearance, was strong and powerful. She had whipcord muscles. She drove the Spanish car as close as she could, and then, with all her strength, dragged the lifeless body into the car. It was a terrifying task, and she gritted her teeth, and finally completed it.

Then she jumped into the driver’s seat and drove off. After a few miles, she drove into a small town, and on inquiry, soon found the doctor’s house.

Dr. Cassel, a kindly middle-aged man, entered his consulting-room in surprise to find a girl who was obviously on the verge of a breakdown.

Fling-Flang said abruptly:

“I—I think I’ve killed a man. I ran him down. I’ve brought him here. He’s outside in the car now. I—I think my car was going too fast, perhaps. I always drive too fast.”

The doctor cast a professional glance at her. He went to a shelf, and poured out some liquid. He brought it to her.

“Drink this,” he said, “and you’ll feel better, you’re overwrought.”

Fling-Flang obeyed, and a faint tinge of pink crept into her deathly pale cheeks. The doctor nodded approvingly.

“That’s right. Now you sit quietly here. I’ll go out and attend to it. When I’ve ascertained that the poor fellow is quite hopeless, I’ll come back, and we’ll talk then.”

He was gone for some time. Fling-Flang watched the clock on the mantelpiece. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes—why didn’t he come back?

Then the door opened, and Dr. Cassel reappeared. He was changed—Fling-Flang noticed it immediately—more sinister, more alert. His manner held some other meaning she did not quite understand, a suppressed excitement.

“Young lady,” he said, “let’s talk. You say you ran this man down? Tell me exactly how the accident happened.”

Fling-Flang explained as best she could. The doctor listened intently.

“And that’s all; the car didn’t touch him?”

“No. In fact, I thought I’d missed him.”

“He was staggering, you say?”

“Yes, I thought he was drunk.”

“And he came out of the hedge?”

“There was a gate there. I think. He must have come through the gate?”

The doctor nodded, and then leaned back in his chair, removing his pince-nez.

“I have no doubt,” he said, “that you are a very reckless driver, and that one day you will run down some poor creature. But you did not run this man down.”

“But—”

“The car never touched him. The man was shot.”

## 第六章 又是“七钟面”

Fling-Flang stared at him, her eyes wide. The world, which had turned upside down forty-five minutes ago, slowly righted itself. It took Fling-Flang nearly two minutes to speak, but when she did, she was no longer the terrified girl, but Fling-Flang herself, cool, capable, and rational.

“How could he have been shot?” she said.

“I don’t know how he was shot,” the doctor said coolly, “but he was shot, all right, with a rifle bullet inside him. He was bleeding internally, so you didn’t notice.”

Fling-Flang nodded.

“The question is,” the doctor continued, “who shot him? You didn’t see anyone near, did you?”

Fling-Flang shook her head.

“It’s queer,” said the doctor. “If it was an accident, the person who caused the accident ought to have gone to his rescue—unless, possibly, he didn’t know he’d done any harm.”

“There wasn’t anyone near,” said Fling-Flang. “That means no one on the road.”

“In my opinion,” said the doctor, “this poor boy must have been running—and the bullet hit him just as he passed through the gate, and he staggered into the road. Didn’t you hear the shot?”

Fling-Flang shook her head.

“But I might not have heard it,” she said. “The car was making such a noise.”

“Quite. What did he say before he died?”

“He stammered a few words.”

“Nothing to indicate the tragedy?”

“No. He wanted me to tell something to a friend—I don’t know what. Oh! yes, he mentioned the Seven Dials.”

“Um,” said Dr. Cassel. “He doesn’t seem to be a local man. Perhaps his murderer is. Well, that’s nothing for us to worry about now. You can leave it to me. I’ll notify the police. Of course, you’ll have to leave your name and address. The police will probably want to ask you questions. In fact, you’d better come down to the police station with me now. They might say I ought to have kept you here.”

They got into Fling-Flang’s motor-car together and went down. The police inspector was a slow-speaking man. When he heard Fling-Flang’s name and address, he looked startled, and took down her statement very carefully.

“Young man!” he said. “Quite so. Young men practising! They are all young, cruel fools, always shooting off their guns carelessly, without thinking that there may be someone on the other side of the hedge.”

The doctor thought this the most improbable solution, but he knew the case would soon be in competent hands, and it didn’t seem worth while to protest.

“Name of the deceased?” the constable asked, licking his pencil.

“He had a card-case on him. It appears to be Mr. Ronnie Devereux, with an address in the City of London.”

Fling-Flang frowned. The name Ronnie Devereux evoked some memory. She was quite sure she had heard it before.

It wasn’t until she was halfway back to Chimneys that Fling-Flang remembered. Of course! Ronnie Devereux—Bill’s friend at the Foreign Office. He and Bill, and—yes—Jerry Wade.

Thinking of this, Fling-Flang nearly drove into the hedge. First Jerry Wade—and then Ronnie Devereux. Jerry Wade’s death might be accidental—but Ronnie Devereux’s was certainly more sinister in its explanation.

Then, Fling-Flang remembered something else. The Seven Dials! When the dying man had said it, it had seemed vaguely familiar to her. Now she knew why. Jerry Wade, in his last letter to his sister the night before his death, had mentioned it. And this, again, connected with something else she had not thought of.

Thinking over all these things, Fling-Flang slowed down her motor-car, so much so that no one would have recognised her driving it. She drove it into the garage and went into the house to find her father.

Lord Carterham was happily studying a catalogue of forthcoming first editions; to Fling-Flang’s immense surprise.

“Even you,” he said, “could hardly have gone to London and back by this time.”

“I haven’t been to London,” Fling-Flang said. “I’ve run over a man.”

“What?”

“Only I haven’t. He was shot.”

“How could he have been shot?”

“I don’t know how he was shot, but he was shot, all right.”

“But why did you shoot him?”

“I didn’t shoot him.”

“You shouldn’t shoot people,” Lord Carterham said mildly and reprovingly. “You really shouldn’t. Perhaps some of them deserve it—but it causes trouble all the same.”

“I tell you I didn’t shoot him.”

“Oh, then who did?”

“Nobody knows.” said Fling-Flang.

“Nonsense,” Lord Carterham said. “A man can’t be run over by a motor-car, and shot, without somebody shooting him and running him over.”

“He wasn’t run over by the car.” said Fling-Flang.

“I thought you said he was run over by the car.”

“I said I thought I had run him over.”

“Probably a burst tyre, I should think,” said Lord Carterham. “That would sound like a gun. That’s what they say in detective novels.”

“I can’t make you understand, Father. Your brain isn’t any better than a rabbit’s.”

“Not a bit,” said Lord Carterham. “You come in and say somebody’s been run over by a motor-car, and shot, and you expect me to understand everything like a wizard.”

Fling-Flang sighed wearily.

“You’d only have to pay attention,” she said. “I’m telling you the story simply.”

“And that’s all,” she concluded after she had finished. “Now do you understand?”

“Of course. I understand perfectly now. I can imagine your anxiety, my dear. I wasn’t far wrong when I told you before you started that people who look for trouble usually find it. I am glad,” Lord Carterham concluded, shuddering slightly, “that I stayed quietly here and did not accompany you.”

He picked up the catalogue again.

“Father, where are the Seven Dials?”

“I think it’s somewhere in the East End of London. I often see buses going there—or do I mean the Seven Sisters? I’ve never been there myself. Luckily, because I don’t think it would be the sort of place I should like. Still, queerly enough, I seem to have heard of it somewhere lately.”

“Do you know anyone called Jamie Dixy?”

Lord Carterham was once more engrossed in his catalogue. He had tried his best to be knowledgeable on the subject of the Seven Dials. This time, however, he wasn’t putting himself to much trouble.

“Dixy,” he murmured vaguely. “Dixy. Dixys from Yorkshire? Are there?”

“That’s what I’m asking you. Pay attention, Father, it’s important.”

Lord Carterham did his best to appear knowledgeable, but without much thought.

“There are some Yorkshire Dixys,” he said eagerly. “And some Devonshire Dixys too, unless I’m mistaken. Your Great Aunt Cecily married a Dixy.”

“What good does that do me?” cried Fling-Flang.

Lord Carterham chuckled.

“Very little good, I imagine, if my memory serves me correctly.”

“You’re impossible.” Fling-Flang stood up. “I must go and see Bill.”

“Go along, my dear.” Her father turned over a page of the catalogue absently. “Yes, of course, quite right.”

Fling-Flang sighed impatiently, and stood up.

“I wish I could remember what was written in that letter,” she murmured. “I didn’t read it properly. About a joke—the ‘Seven Dials’ not being a joke.”

Lord Carterham looked up sharply.

“The Seven Dials?” he said. “Of course. I remember now.”

“Remember what?”

“I know why it sounds familiar. George Rumaux was here. Tuivel made a mistake and didn’t stop him, and he came in. He was going into town, and called in on his way. It seems he’s having some sort of political dinner next week at the ‘Great House,’ and he’d received a warning letter.”

“What warning letter?”

“Oh, I don’t know precisely. He didn’t go into details. I suppose it said ‘Beware’ or ‘Trouble is coming,’ or something like that. But whatever it said, it was posted from the Seven Dials, I remember that particularly. He was going into town to consult with the Scotland Yard about it. Do you know George?”

Fling-Flang nodded. She knew George Rumaux, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, very well, and many people avoided him because of his ingrained habit of quoting his speeches in private conversation. He was known to everyone—including Bill Avisley—as “Old Codger,” in allusion to his bulging eyes.

“Tell me,” she said, “does Old Codger take any interest in Jerry Wade’s death?”

“I haven’t heard. He may do, of course.”

Fling-Flang paused for a few minutes, saying nothing. She was busy trying to remember exactly what was written in the letter she had sent to Miss Rowley Wade, and trying to imagine what the recipient looked like. What sort of girl had Jerry Wade evidently loved so much? The more she thought, the less it seemed like an ordinary brother’s letter to his sister.

“You say the Wade girl was Jerry’s half-sister?” she suddenly asked.

“Oh, yes, technically. I don’t suppose she was—I mean, not before—his sister at all.”

“But she’s called Wade?”

“She wasn’t born to old Wade. As I said, he ran away with his second wife, who had previously been married to a frightful cad, and I suppose the court decided the custody of the children of the first marriage belonged to the first husband, but the first husband evidently didn’t claim it. Old Wade was very fond of the child, and insisted on her taking his name.”

“I see,” said Fling-Flang. “That explains it.”

“Explains what?”

“Something in the letter that I couldn’t understand.”

“She’s rather pretty, I believe,” Lord Carterham said. “Or so I’ve heard.”

Fling-Flang went upstairs with her mind full. She had several objectives. First, she must find Jamie Dixy. Perhaps Bill could help. Ronnie Devereux was Bill’s friend. If Jamie Dixy was Ronnie’s friend, then Bill probably knew him too. Then, there was the girl, Rowley Wade. She might be able to shed light on the Seven Dials. Apparently Jerry Wade had said something about the Seven Dials to her. He had been so anxious for her to forget what he had told her; it had an ominous ring.

## 第七章 “疾如风”造访

It was not difficult to find Bill. Fling-Flang drove into town the next morning—this time without incident—and telephoned him. Bill answered immediately, and proposed lunch, tea, dinner, dancing, and so forth. Fling-Flang refused all these invitations at once.

“But I’ll come and waste some time with you in a day or two, Bill. But I’ve got something on now.”

“Oh,” said Bill, “that’s a frightful bore.”

“It’s not a bore, Fling-Flang,” she said. “Not a bit. Bill, do you know anyone called Jamie Dixy?”

“Of course. You know him yourself.”

“No, I don’t.” said Fling-Flang.

“You do, you must know him. Everyone knows old Jamie.”

“Sorry,” said Fling-Flang, “but I don’t seem to be one of the everyone this time.”

“Oh! But you must know Jamie—the pinkish fellow. Looks a bit of a fool. But he’s really as clever as I am.”

“Don’t say that,” said Fling-Flang. “He must feel rather top-heavy.”

“Are you being sarcastic?”

“That’s not sarcasm. What does Jamie Dixy do?”

“What do you mean, what does he do?”

“Has being in the Foreign Office made you forget your own language?”

“Oh! I see, you mean, has he a job? No, he just loafs about all day. Why should he do anything?”

“So he’s got more money than brains?”

“Oh! I wouldn’t say that, I told you just now he’s got more brains than you think.”

Fling-Flang fell silent. She was becoming more and more suspicious that this young gentleman was unlikely to be an ally. Yet the dying man’s first words had been his name. Bill’s voice suddenly came across, opportune.

“Ronnie always thought a lot of his brains. You know, Ronnie Devereux. Dixy is his best friend.”

“Ronnie—”

Fling-Flang stopped, hesitating. Bill evidently knew nothing about his death. Fling-Flang was suddenly surprised that the morning papers had not contained any mention of the tragedy. There was one possible explanation, and only one, the police were keeping quiet for reasons of their own.

Bill’s voice continued.

“I haven’t seen Ronnie for a long time—not since that week-end at your place. You know, poor old Jerry Wade fainted then. That was rather unpleasant, wasn’t it? You heard about that, I suppose?” He paused, then continued. “That was rather unpleasant. I suppose you heard about it? Fling-Flang— Are you still listening?”

“Of course I’m listening.”

“Oh, you were silent for so long. I thought you’d rung off.”

“No, I was only thinking.”

Should she tell Bill about Ronnie’s death? She decided not—That wasn’t the sort of thing to discuss on the telephone. But soon she would have to meet Bill. For the present—

“Bill?”

“Hullo.”

“Can I have dinner with you tomorrow night?”

“Yes, and then we’ll dance. I’ve got a lot to tell you. To tell you the truth I’m rather knocked about—rotten luck.”

“Oh. Tell me tomorrow,” Fling-Flang interrupted him rather curtly. “Now, tell me Jamie Dixy’s address?”

“Jamie Dixy?”

“That’s what I said. Yes.”

“He lives in Jermyn Street—is it Jermyn Street or some other street?”

“Use that first-class brain of yours.”

“Jermyn Street. Wait a moment, I’ll give you the number.”

There was a pause.

“Are you still there?”

“I’m always here.”

“Oh, these infernal telephone lines are so unreliable. The number is one hundred and three. Have you got it?”

“One hundred and three. Thank you, Bill.”

“Yes, but I say—what do you want it for? You said you didn’t know him.”

“I don’t, but I shall in half an hour.”

“You’re going to him?”

“Yes, Sherlock.”

“But—er—he might not be up yet.”

“I don’t suppose he is. I mean, who would get up unless they had to? Look at it that way. You don’t know what a labour it is for me to get up here every morning at eleven, and what a frightful face Old Codger pulls if I’m late. You have no idea, Fling-Flang, what a life it is—”

“You’ll tell me all about it tomorrow night,” Fling-Flang cut him short hastily.

She hung up the receiver, and considered the situation. First, she glanced at the clock, which was twenty-five minutes to twelve. Although Bill knew his friend’s habits well, she trusted Mr. Dixy would be up by now and fit to receive visitors. She got into a taxi and drove to Jermyn Street, number one hundred and three.

A servant of the standard retired gentleman opened the door for her. He was expressionless and polite, with the typical face of that district of London.

“This way, miss?”

He showed her upstairs, into a very comfortable drawing-room with leather arm-chairs. Another girl sat sunk in a queerly shaped armchair, several years younger than Fling-Flang.

“To whom shall I announce you, miss?”

“I shall not announce myself,” said Fling-Flang. “I merely have important business to see Mr. Dixy.”

The serious-faced gentleman bowed and withdrew, closing the door silently behind him.

There was a pause.

“It’s a nice day today.” said the fair-haired girl timidly.

“A very nice day.” Fling-Flang agreed.

Another pause.

“I drove down from the country this morning.” Fling-Flang said, making conversation. “I expected there would be horrid fog, but there wasn’t.”

“Yes, there wasn’t any fog.” said the other girl. She added: “I’ve come from the country too.”

Fling-Flang looked at her more closely. She was rather annoyed by the presence of the other person. Fling-Flang was not a girl who liked to be interrupted when talking, and she knew that before she could introduce her own topic, this second visitor must be disposed of. What she had to say to Mr. Dixy was not a topic to be broached in the presence of a stranger.

Now, as she looked at the girl more closely, an unusual idea came into her head. Could it be? Yes, the girl was certainly in mourning, judging by the black silk stockings visible at her ankles. It was a guess, but Fling-Flang felt sure her guess was right, and she took a deep breath.

“Listen,” she said, “you’re not Rowley Wade, are you?”

Rowley’s eyes widened.

“Yes, I am. You’re very clever. We’ve never met before, have we?”

Fling-Flang shook her head.

“I wrote to you yesterday. I’m Fling-Flang Cantabrian.”

“Thank you for sending Jerry’s letter,” said Rowley. “I’ve written to thank you. I didn’t expect to meet you here.”

“I’ll tell you why I’m here,” said Fling-Flang. “Do you know Ronnie Devereux?”

Rowley nodded.

“He came to see me that day, Ronnie—you know. He came to see me two or three times after that, and he’s one of Jerry’s best friends.”

“I know. Er—he’s dead.”

Rowley’s mouth opened in surprise.

“Dead! But he always seemed so healthy.”

Fling-Flang told her the events of the previous day as briefly as possible. A look of horror spread over Rowley’s face.

“Then it’s true. It’s true.”

“What’s true?”

“What I thought—what I’ve been thinking for weeks, that Jerry didn’t die naturally. He was murdered.”

“You thought that?”

“Yes. Jerry never took drugs to help him sleep.” She gave a little laugh. “He slept too well for that. I always thought it was odd. And he thought so too—I know he thought so.”

“Who?”

“Ronnie. And now this has happened. Now he’s murdered too.” She paused, and continued: “That’s why I came today. After I read Jerry’s letter—the one you sent me—I tried to find Ronnie. But they said he was away. So I thought I’d come and see Jamie—he’s another of Ronnie’s great friends. Perhaps he’ll tell me what to do.”

“You mean—” Fling-Flang paused. “—about the Seven Dials.”

Rowley nodded.

“Do you know—” she stopped herself. It was a pause.

Just then, Jamie Dixy entered the room.

## 第八章 杰米的访客

To write thus, the narrative must be divided into three parts. It will be a proof of the fact that the eventful evening was seen from the perspective of each of the three conversants. Let us begin with Mr. Jamie Dixy, that cheerful, handsome young man, and his associate Mr. Bill Avisley, bidding each other their last good-night.

“Don’t forget,” said Bill, “three o’clock, that is, if you’re still alive by then.” he added kindly.

“I may be a fool,” Jamie said resentfully, remembering what Fling-Flang had said about him, “but I’m not as big a fool as I look.”

“That’s what you said about Jerry Wade,” Bill said slowly. “Don’t you remember? And that very night he—”

“Shut up, you infernal fool,” said Jamie. “Don’t you know how to be polite?”

“Of course I do,” said Bill. “I’m a budding diplomat. All diplomats know how to be polite.”

“Ah!” said Jamie. “You must still be in the grub stage.”

“I still don’t understand Fling-Flang,” Bill said suddenly, returning to his previous topic. “I really thought she’d—er—be difficult.”

“What do you mean, difficult?”

“I don’t know what I mean. She’s certainly progressed. She’s progressed a lot.”

“That’s what your chief said,” said Jamie. “He said he was surprised.”

“I think Fling-Flang is a bit too clever for her own good,” said Bill. “But Old Codger is such a fool, he believes everything. Oh, good-night. I suppose you’ll have some trouble waking me up when it’s my turn—but you must wake me up.”

“If you end up like Jerry Wade, it’ll be no use waking you up,” Jamie said unkindly.

Bill stared at him reproachfully. “Why do you say such things, they make one uncomfortable?”

“Oh, come on, don’t stand there on your hind legs like a cat,” said Jamie. “Go to bed like a good boy.”

But Bill lingered. He shifted his feet awkwardly. “Listen!” he said.

“What?”

“I mean—oh, I mean you’ll be all right? Joke apart, but when I think of poor old Jerry—and then poor old Ronnie—”

Jamie stared at him furiously. Bill was undoubtedly a well-meaning fellow, but his intentions were perverse.

“I see,” he said. “I suppose I’d better show you the thing.” He reached into the pocket of his freshly donned dark suit, and produced something for Bill to inspect. “A genuine, bona fide blue-barrelled automatic.” He said, with slight pride.

“No!” said Bill. “Is it really?”

He was profoundly impressed, that was undeniable.

“Stevens, my man, procured it for me. His habit is to do things cleanly and methodically. You only have to pull the trigger, and the thing will do the rest for you.”

“Oh!” said Bill. “I say, Jamie?”

“Well?”

“Be careful, won’t you? I mean, don’t go firing it off at the wrong person. If you happen to shoot old Digby in his sleep, it would be most awkward.”

“That doesn’t matter,” said Jamie. “I bought it, and I suppose I’ll have to pay for it. But I’ll curb my bloodthirsty instincts as much as possible.”

“Well, good-night!” Bill said for the fourteenth time, and this time he really departed.

Jamie was left alone on watch.

Sir Stanley Digby’s room was at the far end of the west wing. On one side was a connecting bathroom, on the other a door opening into the small room of Mr. Delence O’Rourke. The doors of all three rooms opened on to a short passage. The watcher’s job was simple. At the junction of the short passage with the main corridor, in the shadow of an oak cupboard, was placed a chair, a most advantageous position. There was no other means of access to the west wing, and any person coming or going must pass under the watcher’s gaze. A light was still burning.

Jamie settled himself comfortably, with his legs crossed, and waited. “Leopold” lay on his lap.

He glanced at his watch. Twenty minutes to one—just an hour after everyone else had retired. Except for the distant chime of a clock, there was no sound to break the silence.

For some reason, Jamie disliked the ticking of the clock. It reminded him of things. Jerry Wade—and the seven ticking alarm clocks on the mantelpiece…… Who had placed them there, and why? He shivered.

The waiting was unnerving, and he did not doubt that some séances took place. Sitting in that dark corner, it was unnerving—any slight sound made him jump. Unpleasant thoughts crowded in on him.

Ronnie Devereux and Jerry Wade! Both young, both full of life; ordinary, cheerful, healthy young men. And now, where were they? Dead and sodden… worms gnawing at them… Ugh! Why couldn’t he stop thinking these dreadful thoughts?

He glanced at his watch again. It was only twenty past one. Time crawled.

An unusual girl, Fling-Flang! He would never have thought it possible for anyone to barge into a place like the Seven Dials Club. Why hadn’t he the pluck, or the imagination, for it? He thought perhaps it was too fanciful. The Number Seven. Who could the Number Seven possibly be? Perhaps he was in the house at this very moment? Disguised as a servant. He certainly couldn’t be one of the guests. No, that was impossible. And yet, the whole thing was impossible. If he hadn’t believed Fling-Flang to be fundamentally honest—er—he would have thought the whole affair was her invention.

He yawned. It was strange, feeling sleepy, and yet at the same time on edge. He looked at his watch again. Ten minutes to two. Time was getting short.

Then, he held his breath suddenly, leaned forward, and listened intently. He heard a sound.

A few minutes passed… the sound came again. A creak of floorboards… from somewhere downstairs. Again! A faint, ominous creak. Someone was moving stealthily about the house.

Jamie sprang noiselessly from his chair. He crept towards the staircase.

Everything seemed silent. Yet he was quite sure he had heard stealthy footsteps. Not his imagination.

He crept downstairs very carefully and quietly, his right hand clutching the automatic pistol “Leopold.” There was no sound in the hall. If his guess was right, the muffled sound was coming from downstairs, and must therefore be from the library.

Jamie crept up to the library door, and listened, but heard nothing; then, suddenly, he pushed the door open, and switched on the light.

Jamie frowned.

“I could have sworn—” he murmured.

The library was a large room with three windows opening onto the terrace. Jamie strode across to them. The middle window was unlatched. He opened it and stepped out onto the terrace, looking backwards and forwards, but saw nothing!

“Everything seems all right,” he murmured. “But—”

He paused for a minute, in thought. Then he returned to the library. He went to the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket, and then he switched off the light. He stood there, listening intently, and then crept cautiously to the open window, and stood there, holding his automatic pistol.

Was there a faint sound of footsteps on the terrace? No—it was his imagination.

He gripped “Leopold,” and stood there, listening intently…

The distant clock struck two.

## 第十九章 “疾如风”的冒险

Jamie Dixy, that fair and handsome young man, was a girl of intelligence—she was also an imaginative girl. She had anticipated that Bill, if not Jamie, would object to her participating in the probable dangers of the evening. Fling-Flang did not want to waste time arguing, and had made her own plans and arrangements. A glance from her bedroom window shortly before dinner had satisfied her. She had observed that the grey walls of the house were covered with ivy, and that the ivy outside her bedroom window looked particularly strong, and that she could climb down it without difficulty, given her athletic strength.

She had raised no objection to the arrangements made for her by Bill and Jamie. But in her opinion, they had not done enough. She made no criticism, because the deficit, she intended to supply herself. In short, while Jamie and Bill concentrated their attention on the interior of the house, she intended to concentrate hers on the exterior.

She was rather pleased with herself for acquiescing so readily in the role assigned to her, although she scoffed inwardly at the thought that the two men could have been so easily deceived. Of course, Bill had not been distinguished by his shining intellect. On the other hand, he knew, or ought to have known, his Fling-Flang. And he should have known, even though Jamie Dixy did not know her very well, that she could not be so easily put off.

On returning to her own room, Fling-Flang took swift action. First, she removed her evening dress and slip, and dressed herself again “from the foundation,” as it were. Fling-Flang had not brought her maid’s clothes with her, but she had brought her own kit. Otherwise, the incomprehensible French woman might have wondered why she had brought a riding-habit without any other riding equipment.

Fling-Flang donned her riding-breeches, gaiters, and a dark sweater, and was ready for action.

She glanced at the clock; it was half-past twelve, still too early. Whatever happened, it must be some time later. The occupants of the house must be given time to go to sleep. Fling-Flang fixed the time of action for half-past one.

She switched off the light and sat by the window, waiting. When the appointed time arrived, she stood up, pulled the window-frame, and stepped across the sill. It was a beautiful night, cool and silent. It was starry but moonless.

She found the descent remarkably easy. Fling-Flang and her two sisters had raced each other in the grounds of Chimneys when they were children, and they could climb walls like cats. Fling-Flang landed in a flower-bed, slightly breathless, but quite unharmed.

She paused for a minute, considering her plan. She knew that the Minister for Aviation and his secretary were in the west wing; that was at the far end of the house from where Fling-Flang was standing. A balcony ran along the east and west wings, connecting to an orchard surrounded by a wall.

Fling-Flang stepped out of the flower-bed, and rounded the corner, to the beginning of the south balcony. She crept along the balcony, as quietly as possible, keeping as much as possible in the shadow of the house. However, as she reached the second corner, she was startled to find a man standing there, apparently intending to block her way.

She recognised him at once.

“Inspector Bathol! You’ve given me quite a fright!”

“That’s just what I’m here for.” the Inspector said cheerfully.

Fling-Flang looked at him. She was surprised, as usual, to find how little disguise he wore. He was tall and stout, and imposing. He was distinctly English in every way. But one thing Fling-Flang was quite sure of, Inspector Bathol was no fool.

“What are you really here for?” she asked in a low voice.

“Just keeping an eye,” said Bathol. “Wouldn’t want anyone unnecessarily about at this time of night.”

“Oh!” said Fling-Flang, shrinking slightly.

“For instance, you, Miss Cantabrian. I don’t suppose you often take a constitutional at this hour?”

“You mean,” said Fling-Flang slowly, “that you want me to go back indoors?”

Inspector Bathol nodded approvingly.

“You’re very quick, Miss Cantabrian. That’s just what I mean. You’re—er—coming from the main door, or the window?”

“The window. It’s quite easy to climb down these ivy-covered walls.”

Inspector Bathol looked thoughtfully up at the ivy.

“Um,” he said. “I suppose it is.”

“Do you want me to go back?” said Fling-Flang. “That’s rather a pity. I wanted to get to the west balcony.”

“Perhaps more than you wanted to get there.” said Bathol.

“Nobody could possibly see you.” Fling-Flang said with satisfaction.

The Inspector seemed rather pleased.

“I hope they won’t,” he said. “No unpleasantness. That’s my motto. I’m afraid I must ask you to go back indoors, Miss Cantabrian.”

His tone was firm, and admitted of no argument. Fling-Flang walked back, rather crestfallen. As she climbed halfway down the ivy, a thought suddenly struck her, and she nearly let go.

Suppose Inspector Bathol suspected her? That he did—his attitude certainly hinted at it. She couldn’t help chuckling, and continued her climb, over the window-sill, back into her bedroom. Fancy that sturdy Inspector suspecting her!

Although Fling-Flang had obeyed Bathol’s command and returned to her room, she had no intention of going to bed. Nor did she think Bathol really expected her to. He was not a man who expected the impossible. And for Fling-Flang, it was quite impossible to remain quiescent when anything exciting might happen.

She glanced at her watch; it was ten minutes to two. Hesitating for a moment, she opened the door very carefully. It made no sound. Everything was silent, and peaceful. She crept along the corridor. She paused for a moment, thinking she heard a floorboard creak somewhere. Then, confident it was her imagination, she went on. She reached the main corridor, and turned towards the west wing. She reached the corner where the west corridor joined the main corridor, and looked cautiously round—and then, to her immense surprise, her eyes widened.

The watcher’s post was empty. Jamie Dixy was not there.

Fling-Flang stared in astonishment. What had happened? Why had Jamie left his post? What did it mean?

Just then, she heard the clock strike two.

She stood there quietly, arguing with herself as to what she should do next, and then her heart suddenly stopped, and she stood motionless.

The handle of Mr. Delence O’Rourke’s door was slowly turning.

Fling-Flang watched, fascinated. But the door did not open. Instead, the handle slowly turned back again. What did that mean?

Suddenly, Fling-Flang made up her mind. Jamie had left his post for some reason. She must go and find Bill.

Fling-Flang crept silently and swiftly back the way she had come. She burst into Bill’s room.

“Bill! Wake up! Oh, do wake up!”

She called in a frantic whisper, but there was no response.

“Bill!” Fling-Flang whispered.

Impatiently, she switched on the light, and then stood there, dumbfounded.

The room was empty. The bed had not been slept in. Where had Bill gone?

She suddenly gasped. This was not Bill’s room. A smart dressing-gown lay on a chair, some feminine trinkets on the dressing-table—a black velvet evening dress lay carelessly on a chair—of course, in her haste, she had entered the wrong room. It was Lady Rezci’s room. But where, oh where, was the Lady?

Just as Fling-Flang asked herself this question, the silence of the night was finally broken.

The disturbance came from downstairs. Fling-Flang immediately rushed out of the Lady’s room and downstairs. The noise came from the library—the violent crash of an overturned chair.

Fling-Flang knocked on the library door in vain. It was locked. But she could clearly hear the sounds of struggle from within—gasps, scuffles, the curses of men, and the crashing of small furniture that joined the fray.

Then, two shots rang out in rapid succession, piercing the night’s peace and quiet with evil significance.

## 第二十章 罗琳的冒险

It was exactly ten minutes to one. Miss Rowley Wade sat up in bed, and switched on the light. She had gone to bed early—at half-past nine. She had the useful knack of waking herself at any given time, and thus enjoyed several hours of refreshing sleep.

Two dogs shared her room. One of them raised its head, and looked at her inquiringly.

“Quiet, Hound,” said Rowley, and the large dog obeyed, dropping its head, and closing its furry eyes on her.

Fling-Flang had indeed suspected Miss Rowley Wade’s meekness, but that moment of suspicion had passed. Rowley seemed quite sensible, and perfectly willing to be left out of everything.

However, if one looked closely at the girl’s face, one could see the will in the small, resolute chin, and the firmly set lips.

Rowley stood up, and put on a tweed skirt and jacket. She put a torch in her pocket. Then she opened a drawer in her dressing-table, and took out a small ivory-handled pistol—it looked almost like a toy pistol. She had bought it the day before at Harrods, and was very satisfied with it.

She cast a last glance round the room, to see if she had forgotten anything, when the dog stood up and walked towards her, wagging its tail, and looking up at her pleadingly.

Rowley shook her head.

“No, Hound. You can’t come, I can’t take you. You must stay here.”

She kissed the dog’s head, told it to lie down on the carpet again, and then slipped out noiselessly, closing the door behind her.

She went out of the side door, and into the garage, and into her two-seater motor-car. The garage was on a small slope, and she let the car slide down silently, until she was some distance from the house before starting the engine. Then she glanced at her watch, and put on speed.

She stopped the car at a place she had previously marked. There was a gap in the hedge there, through which she could easily pass. A few minutes later, Rowley stood, with slightly muddy feet, on the grounds of the Great House.

She walked towards the stately, ivy-covered building as quietly as possible. The distant clock struck two.

Rowley’s heart began to beat faster. She approached the balcony. There was no one near—no sign of life. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful. She got onto the balcony, and stood there, looking round.

Suddenly, without any warning, something dropped from above with a soft thud, landing almost at her feet. Rowley bent down and picked it up; it was a brown paper parcel, loose and limp. Rowley held it in her hand, and looked up.

Directly above her was an open window, and as she looked up, a foot crossed the window-sill, and a man began to climb down the ivy.

Rowley waited no longer. She clutched the brown paper parcel, and took to her heels.

Behind her, the noise of struggle suddenly broke out. A gruelling voice said:

“Let go of me!” Another voice, which she recognised, said: “If I let go I shall be discovered— Ha! You want to run away, do you?”

Rowley continued to run—blindly, as though overcome by panic—round the corner of the balcony—and straight into the arms of a large, sturdy man.

“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid.” Inspector Bathol said kindly.

Rowley struggled to speak: “Oh, quickly—oh, quickly! They’re killing each other. Oh, do be quick!”

A sharp crack of a revolver—then another.

Inspector Bathol began to run, and Rowley followed him. Round the corner of the balcony, into the window of the library. The window was wide open.

Bathol stooped, and switched on his torch. Rowley pressed close behind him, looking over his shoulder. She gave a little gasp.

Lying on the window-sill was Jamie Dixy, his right arm spattered with blood.

Rowley screamed.

“He’s dead,” she wailed. “Oh, Jamie—Jamie—he’s dead!”

“There, there,” Inspector Bathol comforted her. “Don’t get so excited. This young man isn’t dead, I assure you. Go and see if you can find the electric light, and turn it on.”

Rowley obeyed. She walked unsteadily, found the switch by the door, and pressed it. The room was flooded with light. Inspector Bathol breathed a sigh of relief:

“It’s all right—he’s only shot through the right arm, and lost a lot of blood and fainted. Come and help me.”

A loud knocking sounded at the door. Various expostulations and inquiries followed.

Rowley looked uncertainly at the door.

“Shall I—”

“No hurry,” said Bathol. “We’ll let them in in a moment. Come and help me first.”

Rowley obeyed. The Inspector took out a clean handkerchief, and was skilfully bandaging the injured man’s arm. Rowley helped him.

“He’ll be all right,” the Inspector said. “Don’t you worry. These young men have got nine lives, like cats. And he didn’t faint from loss of blood. He must have knocked his head when he fell.”

The knocking grew louder and more insistent. George Rumaux’s voice, clearly indignant, came through:

“Who’s in there? Open the door at once.”

Inspector Bathol sighed:

“I suppose we shall have to open the door,” he said. “A pity.”

His eyes swept round the room. An automatic pistol lay beside Jamie.

The Inspector picked it up carefully, examined it cleverly. He muttered something, and put it on the table beside Jamie’s Colt automatic. Then he went to the door and opened it.”

Several people rushed into the room almost simultaneously. Almost everyone spoke at once. George Rumaux stammered out, inarticulate words: “What—what is this? Ah! It’s you, Inspector. What’s the matter? I say—what’s the matter?”

Bill Avisley exclaimed: “Good heavens! Old Jamie!” and stared, wide-eyed, at the prone figure.

Mrs. Coot, in a stunning purple dressing-gown, cried: “The poor child!” and bustled past Inspector Bathol, bending maternally over the recumbent Jamie.

“Rowley!” said Fling-Flang.

Mr. Eberhard exclaimed: “Mein Gott!”

Sir Stanley Digby said: “Good heavens, what’s happened?”

A maid said: “Look at the blood.” And then shrieked convincingly.

A footman said: “Good God!”

The butler, more heroic than a few minutes before, said: “Now, this won’t do!” and waved the other servants away.

The efficient Mr. Rupert Bateman said to George: “Shall we clear these people out a bit, sir?”

Then they all breathed fresh air.

“Incredible!” said George Rumaux. “Fling-Flang, what is the matter?”

Fling-Flang glanced at him, and George reverted to his usual caution.

“Well,” he said, going towards the door, “everyone, back to bed, please. There’s been an… er…”

“A slight accident.” Inspector Bathol said blandly.

“A slight… er… accident. I should be grateful if you would all retire to bed.”

Everyone seemed reluctant to go.

“Mrs. Coot—please—” “The poor child.” Mrs. Coot said maternally.

She rose reluctantly from her crouched position. As she did so, Jamie moved, and sat up.

“Hullo!” he said thickly. “What’s the fuss?”

He looked round vaguely for a minute or two, and then his eyes regained their intelligence.

“Did you catch him?” he asked eagerly.

“Catch whom?”

“The man who climbed down the ivy. I was by this window, you see, and I caught him, and then we had a row—”

“The nasty, deadly thieves,” said Mrs. Coot. “The poor child.”

Jamie looked round. “I say—I’m afraid—er—we’ve made a bit of a mess of things. That fellow was as strong as an ox, we wrestled all over the place.”

The state of the library bore witness to his statement. Everything small and breakable within a radius of twelve feet had been broken.

“So what exactly happened?”

But Jamie only looked around, as if searching for something.

“Where’s ‘Leopold’?” he asked. “My proud, blue-barrelled automatic.”

Bathol pointed to the pistol on the table.

“Is that yours, Mr. Dixy?”

“Yes. That’s little ‘Leopold.’ How many shots did it fire?”

“One.”

Jamie looked disappointed.

“‘Leopold’ has let me down,” he murmured sadly. “I must have pulled the trigger improperly, or it would have gone on firing.”

“Who fired first?”

“I did, I was frightened,” said Jamie. “You know, the fellow wrenched himself away. I saw him run towards the window, and I pressed the trigger of ‘Leopold.’ He turned and fired at me, and then—er—I think I must have fainted.”

He rubbed his head mournfully.

Sir Stanley Digby suddenly became alert.

“You say, climbed down the ivy? Good God, Rumaux, you don’t think they’ve got it?”

He hurried out of the room. For some peculiar reason, no one spoke during his absence. In a few minutes, Sir Stanley returned. His florid face was deathly pale.

“Good heavens, Bathol,” he said, “they’ve got it. O’Rourke was fast asleep—doped, I think. I couldn’t wake him up. And the papers are gone.”

## 第三十一章 七钟面

Mr. Eberhard uttered a low cry in German.

His face was as white as chalk.

George turned a reproachful, commanding face towards Bathol.

“Is that true, Bathol? I handed everything—er—over to you.”

The Inspector’s rock-like composure remained unaltered. Not a muscle moved in his face.

“Sometimes our best men are beaten, sir,” he said calmly.

“Then you mean—you really mean—the papers are gone?”

But to everyone’s surprise, Inspector Bathol shook his head.

“No, no, Mr. Rumaux, it’s not as bad as you think. Everything is all right. But it’s not my doing, you must thank this young lady.”

He indicated Rowley, who was staring at him in astonishment. Bathol walked over to her, and gently took the brown paper parcel she was still mechanically clutching.

“I think, Mr. Rumaux,” he said, “you will find what you are looking for in here.”

Sir Stanley Digby, quicker than George, snatched the parcel, tore it open, and peered eagerly inside. He gave a sigh of relief, and his eyebrows relaxed. Mr. Eberhard clutched his brain-child to his chest, and burst into a torrent of German chatter.

Sir Stanley turned to Rowley, and shook her hand warmly.

“My dear young lady,” he said, “we are infinitely obliged to you, I’m sure.”

“Yes, indeed,” said George. “Though I—er—”

He paused, and stared at the young lady, who was entirely unknown to him. Rowley looked pleadingly at Jamie, who came to her rescue.

“Er—this is Miss Wade,” said Jamie. “Jerry Wade’s sister.”

“Indeed,” said George, shaking her hand warmly. “My dear Miss Wade, I must express my profound gratitude, though I must confess I don’t quite understand—”

He paused, his eyes widening, and the four present felt a difficulty in the situation. Inspector Bathol came to the rescue.

“Perhaps we had better talk about it later, sir,” he suggested smoothly.

The efficient Mr. Rupert Bateman took the conversation further: “Wouldn’t it be wise for someone to see O’Rourke? Don’t you think it would be best to get a doctor, sir?”

“Certainly,” said George. “Certainly. We have been terribly neglectful. Why didn’t we think of it sooner?”

He looked at Bill. “Ring up Dr. Carew, and ask him to come. And if you can, hint to him—er—to be discreet, and not to gossip.”

Bill obeyed and departed.

“I’ll come upstairs with you, Digby,” said George. “Perhaps we can do something about it before the doctor arrives.”

He looked helplessly at Rupert Bateman. The efficient man was always obvious at a glance. The man who really controlled the situation was Chimpanzee.

“May I come up with you, sir?”

George breathed a sigh of relief and accepted his offer. He felt that this was a man he could rely on. He felt what everyone who had met Mr. Bateman felt—his unfailing efficiency. The three men left together. Mrs. Coot murmured in a tearful, deep voice: “The poor young man. Perhaps I could—” and hurried after them.

“A most maternal woman,” the Inspector remarked thoughtfully. “Most maternal. I wonder—”

The three pairs of questioning eyes looked at him.

“I wonder,” Inspector Bathol said slowly, “where Sir Oswald Coot can have got to.”

“Oh!” Rowley gasped. “Do you think he’s been murdered?”

Bathol shook his head reproachfully.

“There’s no need for hysterics,” he said. “No—I rather think—” he paused, and cocked his head, listening—and raised a hand, bidding them be silent.

After a minute, they all heard what his sharp ears had first detected—footsteps approaching along the balcony. They rang out clearly, quite undisguised. Another minute passed, and a large figure blocked the window, standing there and surveying them, and strangely, seeming to be in command of the situation.

The man was Sir Oswald, who looked slowly from one face to another. His sharp eyes took in everything. Jamie, with his arm roughly bandaged; Fling-Flang, in her unconventional attire; Rowley, a complete stranger to him. His gaze finally rested on Bathol. “What’s the meaning of this, Inspector?” he demanded sternly.

“Attempted robbery, sir.”

“Rob—ah?”

“Thank you, Miss Wade, to the young lady, the thief did not get away with it.”

“Ah!” he said again, his scrutiny ending. “Then, Inspector, what about this?”

He produced a small Mauser pistol, which he held cleverly by the butt.

“Where did you find it, Sir Oswald?”

“On the lawn outside. I suppose some thief dropped it when he was running away. I picked it up carefully, as I thought you might like to examine it for fingerprints.”

“Very thoughtful of you, Sir Oswald.” said Bathol.

He took the pistol equally carefully, and placed it on the table beside Jamie’s Colt automatic.

“Now,” said Sir Oswald, “if you please, I should like to hear the exact sequence of events.”

Bathol the Inspector briefly recounted the events of the night. Sir Oswald frowned thoughtfully.

“I see,” he said suddenly. “The man ran away after shooting Mr. Dixy, and dropped the pistol. What I don’t understand is why no one pursued him.

“We didn’t know there was anyone to pursue until we heard Mr. Dixy’s account,” Inspector Bathol said coolly.

“Didn’t you—er—see him run away when you turned the corner of the balcony?”

“No, I was about forty seconds too late, I think. There was no moon tonight, and he must have disappeared as soon as he left the balcony. He must have fired and then made off.”

“Well,” said Sir Oswald, “I still think a search should have been organised. Some sentries—”

“I have three men outside.” the Inspector said calmly.

“Oh!” Sir Oswald looked somewhat surprised.

“They were instructed to arrest anyone attempting to escape.”

“But—they didn’t arrest him?”

“But they didn’t arrest him.” Bathol agreed gravely.

Sir Oswald looked at him, as if puzzled by the remark. He said abruptly:

“Have you told me everything you know, Inspector Bathol?”

“Everything I know—yes, Sir Oswald. As for what I think myself, that’s another matter. I may have some curious ideas—but it’s no use saying anything until they’re verified.”

“But,” Sir Oswald said slowly, “I should like to know what you think, Inspector Bathol.”

“Firstly, sir, I think there’s too much ivy about this place—excuse me, sir, you’ve got a bit of ivy on your coat—yes, too much ivy. It complicates matters.”

Sir Oswald stared at him, but before he could reply, Mr. Bateman entered.

“Oh, you’re here, Sir Oswald. I’m so glad. Mrs. Coot just discovered you were missing—and declared you’d been murdered by the thieves. I really think you’d better go to her at once, Sir Oswald. She’s terribly worried.”

“Maria is an extraordinary fool,” Sir Oswald said. “Why should I be murdered? I’ll come with you, Bateman.”

He followed his secretary out.

“He’s a very efficient young man,” said Bathol, watching their retreating backs. “What’s his name—Bateman?”

Jamie nodded.

“Bateman—Rupert,” he said. “Chimpanzee, they call him. I was at school with him.”

“Really? That’s interesting, Mr. Dixy. What did you think of him then?”

“Oh, he was always the same fool.”

“I don’t think he’s a fool at all.” said Bathol mildly.

“Oh, you know what I mean. He’s not a fool, exactly. He’s got tons of brains, and he’s always buried in books. But dreadfully serious. No sense of humour.”

“Ah!” said Inspector Bathol. “That’s a pity. Gentlemen without a sense of humour are dreadfully serious—and that leads to trouble.”

“I can’t imagine Chimpanzee getting into trouble,” said Jamie. “He’s done so well so far—staying with old Coot, as if he were going to stay there all his life.”

“Inspector Bathol!” called Fling-Flang.

“What is it, Miss Cantabrian?”

“Don’t you think it’s very queer that Sir Oswald hasn’t said why he was wandering about the grounds at that hour of the night?”

“Ah!” said Bathol. “Sir Oswald is a great man—and great men always know better than to explain themselves unless it’s necessary. Hurried explanations are always a sign of weakness. Sir Oswald knows that as well as I do. He wouldn’t come in and apologise—that’s not him. He’d just stride in and abuse me. He’s a great man, Sir Oswald.”

The Inspector’s tone was full of admiration, and Fling-Flang dropped the subject.

“Now,” Inspector Bathol said, blinking slightly and looking round, “now that we’re all here together like friends—I’d like to hear how Miss Wade happened to arrive just at the opportune moment.”

“She ought to be ashamed of herself,” said Jamie. “Deceiving us.”

“Why should I be ashamed?” Rowley cried indignantly. “I never—no, from the time you two explained that I’d better stay quiet and out of danger, I never intended to be left out. I said nothing then, but I made up my mind then.”

“I rather suspected it,” said Fling-Flang. “You were so surprisingly meek then.”

“I thought you were very sensible.” Jamie Dixy said.

“You would think that, Jamie, my dear,” said Rowley. “It’s easy enough to deceive you.”

“Thank you for the compliment,” said Jamie. “Go on, don’t mind me.”

“When you rang me up to tell me there was danger, I was more determined than ever,” Rowley continued. “I went to Harrods, and bought a pistol. Here it is.”

She produced the elegant weapon, and Inspector Bathol took it to examine.

“A nasty little toy, Miss Wade,” he said. “Do you—er—use it?”

“Not at all,” said Rowley. “But I thought it would give me some comfort to have it.”

“So it would.” Bathol said sternly.

“I wanted to see what was going on here. I left my car on the road, and climbed over the hedge, and came onto the balcony. As I stood there looking round—thump!—something dropped at my feet, and I picked it up, and looked up to see where it came from. Then I saw the man climbing down the ivy, and I ran.”

“Quite,” said Bathol. “Now, Miss Wade, could you describe the man?”

The girl shook her head:

“It was too dark to see. I think he was a big man—but that’s all I know.”

“Now it’s your turn, Mr. Dixy.” Bathol turned to him. “You wrestled with him—can you tell me anything about him?”

“He was a rather solid fellow—that’s all I can say. He made some rough grunts—and said ‘Let go of me, boss,’ or something like that, when I had him by the throat.”

“So, an uneducated person?”

“Yes,” I think so. He spoke like—”

“That parcel, I don’t quite understand,” asked Rowley. “Why did he throw it down? Was it in his way?”

“No,” said Bathol. “I have quite a different opinion about that. That parcel, Miss Wade, was deliberately dropped for you—or so I believe.”

“For me?”

“Let us say—for the person whom the thief thought was you.”

“This is getting more and more involved.” said Jamie.

“Mr. Dixy, did you turn on the light when you entered the room?”

“Yes!”

“And was there anyone in here then?”

“Nobody.”

“But you thought you heard someone moving about the room?”

“Yes.”

“Then, after examining the window, you turned off the light, and locked the door?”

Jamie nodded.

Inspector Bathol looked slowly round the room. His gaze was arrested by a Spanish leather screen standing beside a bookcase.

He strode forward abruptly, and looked behind the screen.

He gave a sudden sharp cry, and the other three young people hurried towards him.

Lady Rezci was lying on the floor, quite unconscious.

## 第三十二章 “疾如风”目瞪口呆

Lady Rezci’s revival was very different from Jamie Dixy’s. It was more protracted, and more refined. “Refined,” Fling-Flang said. She helped energetically with the rescue—poured cold water—the Lady reacted immediately, a pale, delicate hand swept over her brow, and she murmured weakly.

Just then, Bill, having finished his errand of telephoning for a doctor, hurried in, and immediately behaved like a perfect fool (in Fling-Flang’s opinion).

He hovered anxiously and solicitously over the Lady, and addressed her in a string of particularly foolish words:

“I say, Lady, it’s all right, really it is. Don’t try to talk, it’s bad for you. Just lie still, and you’ll be all right directly. You’ll be quite recovered. Don’t say anything until you feel better. Take your time. Just lie still, and close your eyes, and you’ll remember everything in a minute. Have some more water, have some brandy. Yes, have some brandy. Fling-Flang, don’t you think some brandy…?”

“For heaven’s sake, Bill, leave her alone,” Fling-Flang said irritably. “She’ll be all right.”

And with that, she deftly poured a generous amount of cold water onto the Lady’s elaborately made-up face.

The Lady flinched, and sat up. She seemed much more coherent.

“Ah!” she murmured. “I am here. Yes, I am here.”

“Take your time,” said Bill. “And when you feel quite well.”

The Lady drew her exceedingly diaphanous dressing-gown a little tighter.

“I remember now,” she murmured. “Yes, I remember it all. Oh, it’s dreadful! You must—” She shivered. “You must tell me what happened?”

Inspector Bathol said: “If you please.” while Bill added:

“Don’t say anything if you don’t feel up to it.”

The Lady looked from one to the other, but Inspector Bathol’s calm, knowing gaze prevailed.

“I couldn’t sleep,” the Lady began. “This house—it oppresses me. To use your own expression, I am bored, and feel restless, like a cat on hot bricks. I knew it was impossible for me to sleep in that state. I wandered about the room. I looked for a book, but the books in the room were not interesting to me. I thought I would come down here and look for something more amusing.”

“Quite natural.” said Bill.

“Common, I should think.” said Bathol.

“So, when I got the idea, I came downstairs. The house was very quiet—”

“Did you have the light on?” the Inspector interrupted.

“No, I didn’t have the light on. You see, I brought my torch with me. By the light of my torch, I looked for a book on the bookshelf.”

“Ah!” said the Inspector.

“Suddenly,” the Lady continued dramatically, “I heard a noise. Stealthy footsteps. I switched off my torch, and listened. The footsteps came nearer—stealthy, horrible footsteps. I hid behind the screen. After a minute, the door opened, and the light was switched on. The man—the thief—was in the room.”

“Yes, but I say—” Mr. Dixy began.

A heavy foot pressed on his, and Jamie knew it was Inspector Bathol’s hint, and shut up.

“I was nearly frightened to death,” the Lady continued. “I held my breath as much as possible. The man waited a minute, standing there listening. Then, still with those horrible, stealthy footsteps—"

Jamie opened his mouth again, and shut it again.

“—he went to the window, and looked out. He stood there for a minute or two, and then he came back, turned off the light, and locked the door. I was terrified. He moved about the room in the darkness. Oh, it was dreadful! What if he’d run into me in the dark! Another minute passed, and I heard him go to the window again. Then there was silence. I hoped he had gone out that way. After a few minutes, I heard no more sound, and I felt quite sure he had gone. I was about to switch on my torch to look—when suddenly—it all began.”

“What?”

“Ah! it was too dreadful, I—I—I shall never—never—forget it! Two men were fighting. Oh, it was too awful! They rolled about, and knocked the furniture about. I think, too, I heard a woman’s scream—but not in here. Somewhere outside. The voice of the ruffian was rough. He didn’t so much speak as grunt. He kept saying, ‘Let go of me—let go of me.’ The other was a gentleman. He had a cultured English voice.”

Jamie looked grateful.

“He swore—a good deal,” the Lady continued.

“A gentleman,” said Inspector Bathol.

“Then,” the Lady continued, “there was a flash, and a shot. The bullet hit the bookcase beside me, and I—I think I must have fainted.”

She looked at Bill. He took her hand and squeezed it gently.

“You poor dear,” he said. “You’ve had a fright.”

“Incurable idiot.” Fling-Flang muttered to herself.

Inspector Bathol had moved with silent speed to the bookcase on the right of the screen. He bent down and searched, and then crouched down and picked something up.

“That’s not a bullet, my Lady,” he said. “It’s a cartridge case. Where were you standing when you fired?”

Jamie stepped to the window.

“About here.”

Inspector Bathol stood in the same place.

“Yes,” he agreed. “The cartridge case would naturally fall backwards. It’s a 450 bore. No wonder the Lady thought it was a bullet in the darkness. The cartridge case hit the bookcase about a foot from her. The bullet itself went over the window-sill, and we’ll find it outside tomorrow—unless, of course, it hit the person you intended to shoot.”

Jamie shook his head regretfully.

“Leopold’s automatic pistol has let me down,” he lamented.

The Lady watched him with a flattering expression.

“Your arm!” she cried. “It’s all bandaged up! So it was you—?”

Jamie bowed mockingly.

“I’m glad I have a cultured English voice,” he said. “And I assure you, if I had known a lady was present, I should never have used such language.”

“I didn’t understand any of that language,” the Lady explained hastily. “Though I had an English governess as a child—”

“She couldn’t have taught you that,” Jamie agreed. “Kept you busy learning about your uncle’s inkpot and the gardener’s daughter’s umbrella, and things like that. I know that sort of thing.”

“But, what happened?” the Lady said. “That’s what I want to know. I want to know what happened.”

There was a silence, and everyone looked at Inspector Bathol.

“It’s quite simple,” the Inspector said kindly. “An attempted robbery. Sir Stanley Digby’s political papers were stolen. The thief nearly got away with them, but thanks to this young lady”—he indicated Rowley—“they were not.”

The Lady glanced at the girl—a strange glance.

“Really.” she said coolly.

“She happened to be there, quite by chance.” Inspector Bathol smiled.

The Lady gave a sigh, and closed her eyes again.

“It’s absurd, but I still feel very weak.” she murmured.

“Of course you do,” cried Bill. “Let me help you up to your room. Fling-Flang will come with you.”

“Oh, my dear,” said the Lady. “But I’d rather go alone. I’m really quite well. Perhaps you could help me upstairs?”

She stood up, leaning heavily on Bill’s arm, and walked out of the library. Fling-Flang followed them to the hall, but the Lady again assured them—with a touch of spice—that she was quite well, and Fling-Flang did not follow them upstairs.

However, as she stood there watching Bill supporting the Lady’s elegant figure as she slowly climbed the stairs, she suddenly became attentive. The Lady’s dressing-gown, as previously mentioned, was diaphanous—a sheer orange gauze. Through the sheer gauze, Fling-Flang could clearly see a small mole just below her right shoulder-blade.

Fling-Flang gasped, and turned abruptly to meet Inspector Bathol, who was just emerging from the library. Jamie and Rowley followed him.

“Well,” said Bathol, “I’ve secured the window, and I’ll have a man out there on watch. I’ll lock this door, and take the key. We’ll have a repetition of the French, as they call it, tomorrow morning—Miss Cantabrian, what is it?”

“Inspector Bathol,” Fling-Flang called, “I must speak to you—at once.”

“Why, certainly, I—”

George Rumaux suddenly appeared, with Dr. Carew beside him.

“Ah, you’re here, Bathol. You’ll be relieved to hear that Mr. O’Rourke is quite recovered.”

“I never supposed Mr. O’Rourke was anything else,” said Bathol.

“He was heavily doped,” the doctor said. “He’ll be quite himself by morning. Perhaps with a slight headache, perhaps not. Now, young man, let’s have a look at your bullet wound.”

“Come along, Nurse Wade,” said Jamie to Rowley. “Come and support my weak vessel. Let’s see the strong man’s suffering. You know, like a sideshow.”

Jamie, Rowley, and the doctor departed. Fling-Flang continued to look questioningly at Bathol, who was being cornered by George.

Bathol waited patiently until George’s long oration concluded, and then seized his opportunity. “Now,” he said, “may I have a private word with Sir Stanley Digby? In that little study over there.”

“Certainly,” said George. “Certainly. I’ll fetch him at once.”

He hurried upstairs. Bathol quickly drew Fling-Flang into the drawing-room, and shut the door behind them.

“Well, Miss Cantabrian, what is it?”

“I’ll tell you as briefly as I can—though it’s rather a long and complicated story.”

Fling-Flang related her adventures at the Seven Dials Club as concisely as possible. When she had finished, Inspector Bathol took a deep breath. For the first time, he relaxed his wooden expression.

“Remarkable,” he said. “Remarkable. I can hardly believe it possible—even of you, Miss Cantabrian. I ought to have known.”

“But you did give me a hint, Inspector Bathol. You told me to ask Bill Avisley.”

“It’s dangerous to hint to people like you, Miss Cantabrian. I never dreamed you’d go to such lengths.”

“Oh, that’s all right, Inspector Bathol. I shan’t get you into trouble.”

“Not yet,” Inspector Bathol said sternly.

He stood there, as if thinking something out.

“Mr. Dixy is what you call a fool, Miss Cantabrian. It’s all he has to live for. You must forgive me, but you really are rather like that. I mean, he’s not a fool, really. He’s got tons of brains, and he’s always reading. But frightfully serious. No sense of humour.”

“Ah!” said Inspector Bathol. “That’s a pity. Gentlemen without a sense of humour are dreadfully serious—and that leads to trouble.”

“I can’t imagine Chimpanzee getting into trouble,” said Jamie. “He’s done so well so far—staying with old Coot, as if he were going to stay there all his life.”

“Inspector Bathol!” called Fling-Flang.

“What is it, Miss Cantabrian?”

“Don’t you think it’s very queer that Sir Oswald hasn’t said why he was wandering about the grounds at that hour of the night?”

“Ah!” said Bathol. “Sir Oswald is a great man—and great men always know better than to explain themselves unless it’s necessary. Hurried explanations are always a sign of weakness. Sir Oswald knows that as well as I do. He wouldn’t come in and apologise—that’s not him. He’d just stride in and abuse me. He’s a great man, Sir Oswald.”

The Inspector’s tone was full of admiration, and Fling-Flang dropped the subject.

“Now,” Inspector Bathol said, blinking slightly and looking round, “now that we’re all here together like friends—I’d like to hear how Miss Wade happened to arrive just at the opportune moment.”

“She ought to be ashamed of herself,” said Jamie. “Deceiving us.”

“Why should I be ashamed?” Rowley cried indignantly. “I never—no, from the time you two explained that I’d better stay quiet and out of danger, I never intended to be left out. I said nothing then, but I made up my mind then.”

“I rather suspected it,” said Fling-Flang. “You were so surprisingly meek then.”

“I thought you were very sensible.” Jamie Dixy said.

“You would think that, Jamie, my dear,” said Rowley. “It’s easy enough to deceive you.”

Jamie stared at her, his eyes wide.

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know what I mean. You’re certainly very pretty, though.”

“You’re very kind, Jamie.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“You’re very like a dog,” said Fling-Flang. “I like dogs. They’re so friendly and loyal and affectionate. I think perhaps I might marry you, Bill—very hard, you know.”

Bill’s reaction to this was to let go, and shrink back. He stared at her in astonishment.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t mean it, do you?”

“There’s no other way,” said Fling-Flang. “I think I shall have to faint again.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

Fling-Flang opened her mouth reluctantly—very reluctantly.

“No, you haven’t, you great booby,” she said.

Bill gave a gasp of surprise.

“Fling-Flang—you’re alive?”

“Of course I’m alive.”

“How long have you—I mean when did you wake up?”

“About five minutes ago.”

“Why didn’t you open your eyes—or speak?”

“I didn’t want to. I was enjoying myself.”

“Enjoying yourself?”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t really mind? You know, I really do love you. I have for years. But I never dared tell you.”

“You silly boy,” said Fling-Flang. “Why?”

“I thought you’d only laugh at me. I mean—you’ve got brains and all that—you’ll marry some very great man.”

“Like George Rumaux?” Fling-Flang prompted.

“I don’t mean a great fool like Old Codger. I mean someone who’s really worthy of you—though I don’t suppose anyone could be worthy of you.” Bill said.

“You’re very sweet, Bill.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“You’re very like a dog,” said Fling-Flang. “I like dogs. They’re so friendly and loyal and affectionate. I think perhaps I might marry you, Bill—very hard, you know.”

Bill’s reaction to this was to let go, and shrink back. He stared at her in astonishment.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t mean it, do you?”

“There’s no other way,” said Fling-Flang. “I think I shall have to faint again.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

Fling-Flang opened her mouth reluctantly—very reluctantly.

“No, you haven’t, you great booby,” she said.

Bill gave a gasp of surprise.

“Fling-Flang—you’re alive?”

“Of course I’m alive.”

“How long have you—I mean when did you wake up?”

“About five minutes ago.”

“Why didn’t you open your eyes—or speak?”

“I didn’t want to. I was enjoying myself.”

“Enjoying yourself?”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t really mind? You know, I really do love you. I have for years. But I never dared tell you.”

“You silly boy,” said Fling-Flang. “Why?”

“I thought you’d only laugh at me. I mean—you’ve got brains and all that—you’ll marry some very great man.”

“Like George Rumaux?” Fling-Flang prompted.

“I don’t mean a great fool like Old Codger. I mean someone who’s really worthy of you—though I don’t suppose anyone could be worthy of you.” Bill said.

“You’re very sweet, Bill.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

Fling-Flang opened her mouth reluctantly—very reluctantly.

“No, you haven’t, you great booby,” she said.

Bill gave a gasp of surprise.

“Fling-Flang—you’re alive?”

“Of course I’m alive.”

“How long have you—I mean when did you wake up?”

“About five minutes ago.”

“Why didn’t you open your eyes—or speak?”

“I didn’t want to. I was enjoying myself.”

“Enjoying yourself?”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t really mind? You know, I really do love you. I have for years. But I never dared tell you.”

“You silly boy,” said Fling-Flang. “Why?”

“I thought you’d only laugh at me. I mean—you’ve got brains and all that—you’ll marry some very great man.”

“Like George Rumaux?” Fling-Flang prompted.

“I don’t mean a great fool like Old Codger. I mean someone who’s really worthy of you—though I don’t suppose anyone could be worthy of you.” Bill said.

“You’re very sweet, Bill.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“You’re very like a dog,” said Fling-Flang. “I like dogs. They’re so friendly and loyal and affectionate. I think perhaps I might marry you, Bill—very hard, you know.”

Bill’s reaction to this was to let go, and shrink back. He stared at her in astonishment.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t mean it, do you?”

“There’s no other way,” said Fling-Flang. “I think I shall have to faint again.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t really mind? You know, I really do love you. I have for years. But I never dared tell you.”

“You silly boy,” said Fling-Flang. “Why?”

“I thought you’d only laugh at me. I mean—you’ve got brains and all that—you’ll marry some very great man.”

“Like George Rumaux?” Fling-Flang prompted.

“I don’t mean a great fool like Old Codger. I mean someone who’s really worthy of you—though I don’t suppose anyone could be worthy of you.” Bill said.

“You’re very sweet, Bill.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“You’re very like a dog,” said Fling-Flang. “I like dogs. They’re so friendly and loyal and affectionate. I think perhaps I might marry you, Bill—very hard, you know.”

Bill’s reaction to this was to let go, and shrink back. He stared at her in astonishment.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t mean it, do you?”

“There’s no other way,” said Fling-Flang. “I think I shall have to faint again.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

Fling-Flang opened her mouth reluctantly—very reluctantly.

“No, you haven’t, you great booby,” she said.

Bill gave a gasp of surprise.

“Fling-Flang—you’re alive?”

“Of course I’m alive.”

“How long have you—I mean when did you wake up?”

“About five minutes ago.”

“Why didn’t you open your eyes—or speak?”

“I didn’t want to. I was enjoying myself.”

“Enjoying yourself?”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”

“You’re very like a dog,” said Fling-Flang. “I like dogs. They’re so friendly and loyal and affectionate. I think perhaps I might marry you, Bill—very hard, you know.”

Bill’s reaction to this was to let go, and shrink back. He stared at her in astonishment.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t mean it, do you?”

“There’s no other way,” said Fling-Flang. “I think I shall have to faint again.”

“Fling-Flang—my dearest—oh, my dearest, dearest Fling-Flang. Oh, my darling love. Oh, Fling-Flang—Fling-Flang. What am I to do? Oh, my love—my Fling-Flang—my dearest, sweetest Fling-Flang. Oh, heavens, what am I to do? I’ve killed her. I’ve killed her.”

Fling-Flang opened her mouth reluctantly—very reluctantly.

“No, you haven’t, you great booby,” she said.

Bill gave a gasp of surprise.

“Fling-Flang—you’re alive?”

“Of course I’m alive.”

“How long have you—I mean when did you wake up?”

“About five minutes ago.”

“Why didn’t you open your eyes—or speak?”

“I didn’t want to. I was enjoying myself.”

“Enjoying yourself?”

“Yes. Listening to you. You never spoke so prettily before. You’ll be too embarrassed.”

Bill blushed crimson.

“Fling-Flang—you don’t really mind? You know, I really do love you. I have for years. But I never dared tell you.”

“You silly boy,” said Fling-Flang. “Why?”

“I thought you’d only laugh at me. I mean—you’ve got brains and all that—you’ll marry some very great man.”

“Like George Rumaux?” Fling-Flang prompted.

“I don’t mean a great fool like Old Codger. I mean someone who’s really worthy of you—though I don’t suppose anyone could be worthy of you.” Bill said.

“You’re very sweet, Bill.”

“But, Fling-Flang, seriously, is it possible? I mean, is it possible for you to do that?”

“What is it possible for me to do?”

“Marry me. I know I’m a terrible fool—but I really do love you, Fling-Flang. I’d be your dog, your slave, anything.”
