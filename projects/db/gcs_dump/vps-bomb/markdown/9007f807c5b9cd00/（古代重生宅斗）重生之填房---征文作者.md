The woman's words were like a sharp knife, piercing her heart. She knew that these people were too hypocritical. They all thought that she was a fool. She had only been reborn for a few days, but she already knew that these people had hidden motives.

"I know my place, and I know what I'm doing." She said to the woman, "My husband knows what he's doing. He doesn't want me to be his daughter-in-law."

The woman smiled slightly and said, "Don't worry, your husband is a good man. He will definitely be good to you."

She smiled faintly and said, "I know, but I don't know if he will listen to me."
