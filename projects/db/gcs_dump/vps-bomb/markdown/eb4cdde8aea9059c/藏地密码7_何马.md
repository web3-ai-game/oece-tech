### 第一节 地图上的页码

方新教授道：“怎么不可能？你知道狼的社会团体吗？一头幼狼从断奶后到学会团体协作捕猎，学会认清自己在社团里的等级和地位，学会辨认猎物的身体健康状况，守护自己的领地等等，谁教它们？还不是老狼教小狼。按照文中的说法，应该有百余头獒生活在一起，它们只需将这些技能，当作自己生存和捕猎的必要技巧，传给下一代就可以了，所以獒能训獒，獒能教獒，不需要人去干扰。问题是德军为什么要把它们作为资料收集成册？难道是说，德军在二战中也准备发展兽战？”

卓木强巴摇头道：“这个……”

方新教授道：“这件事先放这里吧，来，跟我说说你们这次去工布村发现了什么。找到入口了吗？”

张立道：“何止，我们还验证了地图，连地下河的船都找到了！”

“什么船？”方新教师问道。

岳阳简短地将他们看到的牛皮船向方新教授做了描述，又取出图片让方新教授看，教授看了之后，神色严肃道：“看来是这样了，这不是牛皮船。”

“嗯？”卓木强巴惊奇道：“我们西藏不是只有牛皮船么？”

方新教授道：“你太小看西The book is titled "Tibetan Code 7" by He Ma. The following is an excerpt from Chapter 46, titled "The Great Wheel Sutra: The Highest Code of Tibetan Esotericism."

Professor Fang Xin stated, "Why is it impossible? Do you know about wolf social structures? A wolf cub, from weaning until it learns to hunt cooperatively, recognizes its rank and position within the pack, discerns the health of its prey, and defends its territory, etc. Who teaches them? It's the older wolves teaching the younger ones. According to the text, over a hundred mastiffs should be living together. They only need to pass these skills on to the next generation as necessary survival and hunting techniques. Therefore, mastiffs can train mastiffs and teach mastiffs, without human interference. The question is, why did the German army collect this as documented material? Does this mean the German army was also planning to develop animal warfare during World War II?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba shook his head, "This..."

Professor Fang Xin said, "Let's put this aside for now. Come, tell me what you discovered in Gongbu Village this time. Did you find the entrance?"

Zhang Li exclaimed, "More than that! We've verified the map and even found the boat on the underground river!"

"What boat?" Professor Fang Xin inquired.

Yue Yang briefly described the cowhide boat they saw to Professor Fang Xin and showed him the pictures. After looking at them, the professor's expression turned serious, "It seems so. This is not a cowhide boat."

"Huh?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked in surprise, "Don't we only have cowhide boats in Tibet?"

Professor Fang Xin responded, "You underestimate the technology of Tibet, Qiangbala. But it's understandable. To this day, much of Tibet's ancient civilization remains undiscovered. Due to the turbulent rivers and mountains on both sides, only cowhide boats have survived. Large boats like this were recorded in Tubo history as 'snake boats.' Ancient Tibet had two commonly used types of boats. One was a large wooden boat called a 'horse-headed boat,' which went through three phases: flat-bottomed, pointed-bottomed, and wedge-bottomed, accommodating between 20 and 50 people. It is said that Master Padmasambhava arrived in Tibet on a horse-headed boat. The other type is the cowhide boat, still in use today. Initially, cowhide boats had round bottoms, similar to modern bumper boats, and later developed into a trapezoidal shape. Besides these two common types, there were also log canoes and double-grooved boats, modified according to different regions and geographical environments. However, these boats had their issues."

Professor Fang Xin drew a square boat on the tabletop and explained, "Taking the horse-headed boat as an example, it has a large capacity and can carry many people, making it suitable for long-distance voyages. However, in most areas of Tibet, the river channels are narrow and the slopes are very steep, making horse-headed boats prone to hitting reefs and capsizing. Cowhide boats, on the other hand, are lightweight, durable, and resistant to collisions, capable even of navigating turbulent rapids. That's why they are still in use today. However, their volume is too small, usually accommodating only 3 to 5 people, and they are not suitable for long-distance transportation, serving at best for crossing rivers. Therefore, some Tibetans invented this 'snake boat,' which combines the advantages of both the horse-headed boat and the cowhide boat, being both lightweight and durable, and capable of carrying many people. The hull is constructed from multiple interlocking keel sections, resembling the spine of a vertebrate. Ribs extend from the keel, and the hull is shuttle-shaped, narrow and agile. The entire boat resembles a giant python, hence the name 'snake boat,' 'serpentine boat,' or 'dragon boat' in some areas, although it differs greatly from inland dragon boats."

Yue Yang asked in surprise, "Professor, since when did you become so knowledgeable about boats?"

Professor Fang Xin smiled faintly and said, "After returning from the Floating Temple, when Qiangbala mentioned the murals, I started paying attention to the large boats that appeared in ancient Tibet and found some information. He paused and added, "However, the information about these snake boats was provided by Master Tashi. There is no corroborating evidence in historical records. Moreover, I doubted back then where one would find such large hides to stretch for such long boats. The materials you brought back have provided me with concrete evidence."

Master Yala and Zhang Li presented the materials, and Yue Yang pointed to the serpentine boat, stating, "This resolves some issues, but new problems have emerged."

Professor Fang Xin asked Yue Yang, "What new problems?"

Yue Yang replied, "The main problem now is whether that boat, having been submerged in the underground river for over three years, is still usable. And the lingering question in my mind is how that madman could have single-handedly piloted such a large boat out of the darkness back to the outside world. If there were a dozen people, with ample food, it would be understandable."

Professor Fang Xin mused, "It's possible there were a dozen people, and only he survived in the end."

Yue Yang countered, "What about the food? Surely a dozen people would have left some clues on the boat."

Professor Fang Xin replied, "There are microorganisms in that underground river. Over three years, any clues would have been decomposed by the microorganisms in the water. But why hasn't the boat decayed?"

Yue Yang handed the boat scales and wood chips they had collected to Professor Fang Xin. Professor Fang Xin smiled slightly, realizing he would have to trouble his old friends in the botany and biology departments again. Master Yala and Zhang Li had already uploaded the data to the computer. Professor Fang Xin reviewed it carefully. After finishing, he suddenly said, "Ah, I can ask Old Zhu for help. He specializes in caves. Wait..."

The professor made a phone call and connected to the internet on his computer, transmitting the video. Shortly after, a voice echoed back from the video call. A man about sixty years old appeared on the screen, looking excited. "Old Fang, where did you get this documentary footage?"

Professor Fang Xin replied, "We'll discuss that later. For now, I want to know about the general characteristics of this type of cave. Based on your observations, what would it be like inside? Try to explain it simply; you know I don't research this."

Old Zhu responded, "Alright. It's currently impossible to determine whether this is a super-giant natural cave or a karst cave formed by water erosion. If it's a natural cave, the tunnels inside would be lava tunnels. If we judge by the rock type, which I tentatively identify as a type of metamorphic rock, this video was likely filmed in an area that experienced orogenic movement. The entrance looks quite strange; it's definitely not a collapsed cave formation, but rather looks like an artificially constructed passage. Regardless, it's undoubtedly a sinkhole. We can't call this entrance an underground stream because it has a phreatic zone, and inside is an underground river. It's quite strange, isn't it? Why do I think it's a natural cave? Because I didn't see any flow marks inside, nor did I find any stalactites or stalagmites..."

"Okay," Professor Fang Xin interrupted, "Old Zhu, I didn't understand a word you said. How about this: I have a few questions for you. Can you answer them simply using your professional knowledge?"

The elder Zhu replied, "Huh? Wasn't I being simple enough?"

Professor Fang Xin stammered, "Uh, perhaps you find it simple, but we don't understand many of the terms. I just want to know if such a cave could form a vast underground water system."

Old Zhu exclaimed, "Possible? It's very possible! It shouldn't be called an underground water system; it should be called an underwater cave system. If it's a natural cave that was later filled with water, it could absolutely be a very large underwater cave system, possibly even exceeding Mammoth Cave in the United States or the cave recently discovered in Mexico, what's-its-name..."

Professor Fang Xin then asked, "And would the rock formation be prone to collapse or anything like that?"

Old Zhu replied, "It depends on the height of the rock strata. If the strata are twenty to thirty meters high, you generally don't need to worry about these issues. Because if it's volcanic metamorphic rock, its hardness is beyond your imagination."

Professor Fang Xin stated, "I know that groundwater is layered. Do you think an underwater cave system like this could have underground waterfalls or voids?"

Old Zhu hesitated, seemingly flipping through the video footage. He then said, "I can't be sure. I need to consult with some colleagues and review a lot of material before I can give you a definitive answer. However, looking at a lava tunnel like this, it's unlikely to have sudden faults. But deep canyons formed by underground steep slopes are possible. Also, stepped platforms with drops of two or three meters are possible. Those waterways would fall under the category of rapid flow rafting, which is extremely dangerous. Old Fang, are you asking this because someone plans to explore this cave further?"

Professor Fang Xin didn't answer directly, only smiled. Old Zhu's expression changed, "Who is so bold? But speaking of which, their underwater light anchors are quite professional! Old Fang, you must call me for this kind of thing!"

Professor Fang Xin still didn't answer directly, smiling, "There will be opportunities, there will be opportunities."

After ending the video call with Old Zhu, Professor Fang Xin looked at everyone and asked, "You've all heard what the cave expert said. This underground river channel might not have waterfalls, but the turbulent currents and undertows you experienced are definitely present, and in more than one location."

Master Yala stated, "If the time proportions are correct, we would need three days to complete the entire underground river journey. For us old team members, it should be manageable, but what about the new members..."

Yue Yang interjected, "We should inform the instructor immediately. She can arrange some targeted training. I remember that year, when we undertook an unprecedented reconnaissance mission, the instructor tailored a training plan for us. In just one week, she transformed us from rookies into capable individuals for that mission. I'll contact the instructor right away."

Professor Fang Xin responded, "Alright. I'll need some time to find experts to study the silkworm cocoon, bark, and other materials you brought back."

Zhang Li added, "I also need time to adjust the new equipment and check the boat."

Professor Fang Xin concluded, "Then everyone, please make the most of this last period to complete your tasks. Thorough preparation is essential to ensure the success of this operation!" He turned to Zhuo Mu Qiangba and asked, "Qiangbala, how is your health? Have you had any unusual feelings recently?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba shook his head, "No, everything is fine."

Professor Fang Xin remarked, "That's good. I was a little worried that something like what happened in Russia might occur during your trip to Gongbu Village."

"Hmm?" Master Yala inquired, "What happened? Can Young Master Qiangba tell us about it?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba recounted the incident where his body suddenly filled with strength, and then he became unable to move. Finally, he mentioned that he had asked Lü Jingnan about it, and Master Tashi had also examined him. Master Yala nodded thoughtfully and said nothing further.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba requested a Mongolian Basiba script translation from Professor Fang Xin, wanting to study this translation in detail, especially the part about the beastmaster Sangjie taming war mastiffs. He felt a sense of familiarity.

Unexpectedly, on the night he returned from Motuo, just as Zhuo Mu Qiangba was falling asleep, Lü Jingnan called. She asked, "Young Master Qiangba, do you... have any abnormal sensations?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba hadn't expected Lü Jingnan to ask such a private question. The cheek against the phone felt hot, and he mumbled, "No... no sensations."

Lü Jingnan replied over the phone, "That's strange. The root chakra is the last of the seven chakras. According to this breathing method, you should feel a slight warmth in the root chakra within two to three months and gradually show signs of the root chakra about to open. Young Master Qiangba, why are you not reacting?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba, blushing, replied, "Per... perhaps I haven't paid attention usually. I'll be more mindful from now on. Alright, thank you for telling me so much. Now that I understand the reason for that situation in my body, I have nothing else to worry about. Goodbye."

Minmin, leaning on Zhuo Mu Qiangba's shoulder, asked, "Was that instructor Lü Jingnan's call?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba nodded. Suddenly, he remembered, "Master Tashi seemed to say that my chakras couldn't be opened! How could I forget so quickly!"

Minmin said indignantly, "She's calling so late."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba explained, "Didn't I tell you? A while ago in Russia, my body suddenly couldn't move. Afterwards, I asked Lü Jingnan to help me figure out the reason. Actually..." He suddenly remembered his promise to Lü Jingnan and changed the subject, "Actually, it's nothing."

Tang Min's gaze dimmed, thinking, "I'm the doctor, why didn't he ask me?" She didn't press further, only held Zhuo Mu Qiangba's arm tighter.

The next day, Zhuo Mu Qiangba focused on studying the 1287 Basiba script translation, hoping to find something related to Paba La. If so, it would fill the five-hundred-year vacuum regarding Paba La. Unfortunately, after comparing every character in the translation, he couldn't find any connection to Paba La. Thus, Professor Fang Xin's question lingered in his mind: why did the German army place these two folders amidst materials related to Paba La? Could that Russian have made a mistake and collected all the declassified materials he could find? Even so, what use would the Germans have for such a Mongolian document? Was it truly to develop beast warfare? However, the description of beast warfare in the entire translation was not detailed, with the only mention of more detail being the war mastiffs. Could it be that the German army was also interested in war mastiffs?

He revisited the movements and pronunciation of the beastmaster, simulating the same actions with his own understanding. Just as he was becoming more adept, Master Yala knocked and entered. Looking at Zhuo Mu Qiangba, he asked, "Young Master Qiangba, do you remember asking me about the meaning of the symbol in the lower right corner of that wolfskin map?"

"...Of course," Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied after thinking. Master Yala was referring to the seal-like pattern formed by horizontal and vertical lines on the edges of both wolfskin maps. They found Professor Fang Xin, and the professor brought up the map on the computer.

Master Yala stated, "An elder in our sect, knowledgeable in scriptures, found the same icon on a fragment of scripture. The master said, pointing to the bottom corner of the map on the computer, 'We have also figured out its meaning. It's a number.' The master pointed with his finger, counting from top to bottom, row by row: '3, 2, 5.'"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't help but ask, "What does this number mean? On which scripture fragment was the same number found?"

Master Yala did not answer directly but pressed a button, bringing up another wolfskin map. He read downwards, row by row, "3, 2, 4."

Professor Fang Xin suddenly realized, "These numbers are page numbers! How foolish, we never thought to consider numbers."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed in surprise, "Page numbers? Page numbers! Could it be that!"

Master Yala nodded, "These two maps, one genuine and one fake, are merely two pages from a scripture. The envoy gave the King of Guge a token, which was a thick scripture. Just like rubies and a castle under the light, the scripture and the map were also separated, scattered to the ends of the earth."

Minmin, attracted by Zhuo Mu Qiangba's exclamation, came over and asked, "What's wrong?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba explained the discovery by Master Yala and the others. Minmin looked at the map again and exclaimed, "Oh, it's true! Isn't that how the Maya express their numbers? We never thought of it."

Professor Fang Xin shook his head, "No, Maya numbers are expressed using dots, dashes, and circles, while these numbers are expressed using horizontal and vertical lines. These are not Maya numbers; it's the ancient Chinese method of counting rods. Their expression method is basically the same as Maya numbers, only a dot has become a vertical line."

"What kind of scripture could it be?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked again.

Master Yala enunciated each word, "The Great Wheel Sutra!"

Both Zhuo Mu Qiangba and Professor Fang Xin were stunned. Tang Min covered her mouth in surprise. No one had expected that the wolfskin maps, which they had considered the second token, were merely part of the token. The real second token turned out to be the highest scripture of Tibetan Esotericism, the Great Wheel Sutra!

Master Yala stated calmly, "This scripture, which encompasses the essence of Esoteric Buddhism, has exuded mystery from the day it appeared. At the beginning of the later dissemination of Tibetan Buddhism, Master Atisha established an altar upon entering Tibet and began his first lecture on the Great Wheel Sutra, emphasizing that this was a scripture that had circulated out of Tibet, and he was merely bringing it back. However, no one knows who authored this scripture or when. Furthermore, its all-encompassing content makes it impossible to guess what kind of person possessed such great wisdom and profound knowledge. Now, when I think about it carefully, only they—" he paused, "—had that capability!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba gasped in shock, "Guangjun!"

Professor Fang Xin nodded, "Guangjun is the guard of the Four Temples, and the Four Temples house all the scriptures from the peak period of Tibetan Buddhism. Not only that, but it also includes Bon scriptures and those introduced from the Tang Dynasty and India."

Master Yala explained, "That's why there's the saying that one who understands the Great Wheel Sutra can understand all scriptures, because this scripture itself is an extraction of the essence from various religious thoughts."

"Ah!" Tang Min exclaimed softly. Zhuo Mu Qiangba quickly asked, "What's wrong, Minmin? Did you think of something?"

Tang Min recalled, "I remember when I was researching information about Shambhala (a transliteration of the Tibetan word, also translated as 'Shangri-La,' meaning 'Land of Bliss'), I saw a statement that this Great Wheel Sutra originally had twelve thousand verses, but Master Atisha only brought back twelve hundred verses to Tibet. Nine-tenths of the content was lost!"

Master Yala confirmed, "Yes, that's correct. And Master Atisha himself said it. When he began lecturing on the Great Wheel Sutra, he explicitly stated that this scripture originally had twelve thousand verses, but through various twists and turns, by the time it reached him, only one-tenth of the content remained."

Tang Min added, "Do you remember what the translation of the Guge Golden Book said? The envoy changed his mind upon arriving at Zhabrang. He wanted to take the castle under the light to the ends of the earth, and he also asked the King of Guge to safeguard another token. The translation we saw stated that one version said the King of Guge secretly sent the token away, while another version said the token was a map, and the King of Guge kept it! The envoy himself left the red stone at the Gate of Life but sent the castle under the light to the Americas. If we follow his actions..."

Professor Fang Xin slapped the armrest and exclaimed, "This way, the translations are no longer contradictory. The King of Guge did indeed keep part of the token and secretly sent away the other part. The wolfskin maps and the Great Wheel Sutra complement each other. Without the descriptions in the Great Wheel Sutra, you wouldn't know how to take the first step with just the map; and with just the descriptions in the Great Wheel Sutra, without the map—|qī|shu|ωang|—you wouldn't be able to find Shambhala!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba excitedly added, "This way, we can clearly see their travel routes. One crossed the Pacific eastward, and the other went westward. The scripture reached India, or somewhere further west than India. This was the agreement between the envoy and the king that year: to separate the tokens and send them to the ends of the earth, never to meet again!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba clapped his hands with a loud "snap."

Professor Fang Xin contemplated, "King of Guge couldn't have delivered the scripture himself; he must have sent someone..."

Minmin immediately responded, "He did send someone! Didn't he once dispatch 21 wise disciples to the West to seek the Dharma?"

Professor Fang Xin and Master Yala exchanged glances. Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "Yes! Scriptures are different from bronze mirrors. They could have disassembled them. If divided into twenty-one parts, with each disciple taking one..."

Master Yala explained, "Both the Great Translator Rinchan Sangpo and Ore Bisherong were disciples of Master Atisha. If the Great Wheel Sutra was divided into twenty-one parts, then Master Atisha received nearly one-tenth of the content, which is why he could confidently say that the scripture originated from Tibet, and the complete Great Wheel Sutra has twelve thousand verses!"

Minmin's eyes widened in disbelief, "This... Isn't that too much of a coincidence!" Professor Fang Xin also hit the armrest, exclaiming, "History and legend, to some extent, coincide!"

Master Yala countered, "No! Coincidences rarely occur in history. Everything that happens is closely interconnected. King of Guge aspired to Buddhism, that's true, but no one can clearly explain why Yeshe Wo renounced the throne so devoutly. Why did he suddenly think of sending 21 disciples to India? And why did he later insist on inviting Master Atisha to Guge to propagate Buddhism, regardless of his own life?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba agreed, "Yes, if King of Guge sent people to deliver the Great Wheel Sutra and have them dispersed all over the West, why did he insist on inviting Master Atisha back in his later years, even risking his own life? Isn't that contradictory?"

Professor Fang Xin pondered, "Don't you think the actions of King of Guge resemble the actions of another person? Someone who initially held a rejecting attitude, but in his later years, suddenly became fanatical, as if possessed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba inquired, "You're talking about..."

### 第二节 最后的准备

Professor Fang Xin stated, "Landa, the person who destroyed the Maya civilization, and yet, in his later years, became its pioneer and explorer."

Master Yala disagreed, "No, the attitude of King of Guge and Landa still have significant differences. The translation shows that from the beginning, King of Guge held a respectful attitude towards the envoy and the tokens he brought. Perhaps it was at the envoy's request that he was forced to disassemble the complete scripture and send people away with it. After the envoy left or passed away, he desperately wanted to retrieve the scripture because he knew this scripture was compiled by us Tibetans ourselves—a cultural treasure! If the Great Wheel Sutra is the essence of the literature in the Four Temples, or an index, then it also contains books on religion, culture, agriculture, commerce, technology, and more. Perhaps the truly complete Great Wheel Sutra encompasses all aspects of ancient Tubo, the Tang Dynasty, and the peak of India—a comprehensive encyclopedia!"

Minmin cheered excitedly, "That's great! Where is that scripture? Perhaps we can find more information about Paba La from it!"

Master Yala smiled, "Didn't you already see it when you were looking up Shambhala information some time ago?"

Minmin replied, "But I saw a printed edition, not the original text..."

Master Yala shook his head, "Where can we find the original manuscript of the Great Wheel Sutra? Since Master Atisha began lecturing on the Great Wheel Sutra, this scripture has become the core ideology of many sects in the later dissemination of Tibetan Buddhism. Just like Confucius's Analects, Confucius's thoughts were inherited, but who can find the manuscript personally written by Confucius back then? Even if we could find the original manuscript of the Great Wheel Sutra, the part that has been passed down only relates to religion, being only one-tenth of the content."

Minmin pointed out, "But, Master, didn't you say that an elder in your religion saw that, that pattern? Isn't that pattern on the Great Wheel Sutra?"

Master Yala shook his head and corrected, "It's a fragment of the Great Wheel Sutra, yes. Our sect does have the original manuscript of the Great Wheel Sutra, but it's only one page, about one-seventh of a page. Those are kept by the most compassionate and wise elders. As for people like us..." Master Yala shook his head again.

Professor Fang Xin stated, "We have already found enough information from the transmitted Great Wheel Sutra. Even if we saw the complete Great Wheel Sutra, perhaps we wouldn't gain much more. Moreover, perhaps other scriptures also use the same method to express numerical page numbers. The wolfskin maps may not be part of the Great Wheel Sutra. These are all our conjectures. Let's focus our energy on historical documents and the materials collected this time." The old professor stroked his white hair, completely unaware at that moment that the Great Wheel Sutra, the Mongol Empire, and Nazi Germany were all interconnected.

In the following period, various preparations were carried out busily and methodically. Professor Fang Xin sent the boat skin samples and keel structures collected by Zhuo Mu Qiangba to relevant industry experts through his channels—those were his friends, or friends of friends. Of course, they weren't just waiting for results; the frequently consulted historical materials were back on the table, and they also undertook intensive self-study on volcanic knowledge. Zhuo Mu Qiangba spent most of his time meditating and taming mastiffs, as if he were back in the early days of the Sky Lion Group, with a large group of mastiffs surrounding him. He repeatedly studied every movement and pronunciation of the ancient beastmaster. Sometimes, even in his sleep, he would issue commands to the mastiffs, causing Minmin to complain several times.

Meanwhile, Zhuo Mu Qiangba was gradually adapting to his new role as captain. The relationships within the group were currently very delicate. Lü Jingnan, Master Yala, and Master Tashi were closer. Captain Hu Yang and his former teammates naturally spent more time together. Zhang Li and Yue Yang each had their own tasks, but young people always liked to gather in groups. Basang continued to play the role of the stern instructor. Sean was good at interacting with people and navigated smoothly among everyone. Wang You tended to be more independent, somewhat like Master Yala when he first joined the team. Within these small groups, when Minmin and Lü Jingnan met, there was a tacit sense of rivalry. Lü Jingnan always reminded Zhuo Mu Qiangba to be mindful of gossip and to selectively share information with everyone. Lü Jingnan, Master Yala, Master Tashi, and others seemed to be resistant to those who joined later, always maintaining a distance from the newly joined team members, especially Sean and Wang You, and Basang. On the other hand, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Sean, and others preferred to immerse themselves in crowds, being indispensable everywhere.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba had to pacify all parties and unite them into a cohesive whole, preventing minor conflicts from fracturing the team's camaraderie.

After Zhang Li inspected the equipment and instruments, he prepared to return to the Styx River with a batch of new instruments. As for assistants, in addition to Master Yala, Lü Jingnan recommended Master Tashi. Considering the religious aspect and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the Gate of Hell, Zhuo Mu Qiangba agreed. Zhang Li and his team would also bring some positioning devices. Lü Jingnan mentioned that helicopters could be used to air-drop supplies near the Gate of Hell, so even if the helicopters were tracked by satellites, the specific location of the Gate of Hell could not be identified.

The specimens Professor Fang Xin had asked experts to examine also yielded results. The first to be tested was the jade silkworm. Experts from the jewelry appraisal industry immediately identified it as no ordinary jade silkworm, but a silicified living insect. Typically, such gemstones belong to the opal family and are millions of years old. Through special geological changes and under low temperature and high pressure, the silica crystals gradually replaced the original biological form of the animal or plant, transforming into a quasi-gemstone with a hardness of 6.5-7.0. It is commonly found in ancient primitive forests in Myanmar, Vietnam, and other regions. This silicified crystal, known as petrified jade, has only been classified as an ornamental gemstone in the last one or two decades.

Two days later, the air quality report came out. The air quality brought back by Zhuo Mu Qiangba and his team was excellent, even outstanding, completely suitable for human respiration, with no harmful impurities.

Another two days later, the water analysis report was also completed. Items such as color, total hardness, bacterial count, and various chemical elements—dozens of them—all met drinking water standards. Furthermore, the dissolved oxygen content in the water was far higher than in oxygenated water; the degree of dissociation of cations and anions was far higher than in ionized water; the activity of water molecules was far higher than in static magnetized water and was relatively stable, capable of being maintained long-term without being affected by external environmental factors.

According to the professor, the researcher who studied the underground river water even proposed a collaborative plan to develop it into a beverage, stating it would be countless times better than the popular mineral water, purified water, and ecological water on the market.

A week later, Professor Fang Xin received the rock analysis report. According to the analysis, it was rhyolite. The rock's age would require specific isotopic analysis of zircon mineral crystals, but it would undoubtedly be billions of years old, possibly even surpassing the granite gneiss in the eastern Hebei region of China to become the oldest rock formation in China. Its physical hardness was 23 Prall, and its Mohs hardness was 7.8, which explained why Zhang Li had such difficulty chiseling it that day. Its specific gravity was 4.6-4.71, its refractive index was 1.93-2.01, and its melting point was 2550℃. Its luster was greasy, its density was 5.8g/cm², and it contained a large number of chemical elements such as Zr, Ti, Si...

A few days later, the results for the fine sand collected by Yue Yang came out. According to the report, sand, clay, and microbial remains were separated from it. The sand grains were fine, with a particle size of 0.15-0.25mm. The main component was still silicon dioxide, although it contained more chlorine and other chemical impurities. The soil component was clay soil, which had been sent to the relevant research group at the China University of Geosciences for analysis. The specific composition was pending.

Zhang Li and his team had also returned. From their daily reports, Zhuo Mu Qiangba learned that the boat's collision resistance and shock absorption performance were excellent. Even with today's materials, it would be difficult to build such a resilient boat. With Zhang Li's efforts, much of the heavy equipment had been installed and secured, waiting for the remaining new team members to complete their specialized training before they could depart.

However, what remained puzzling was that no conclusion had been reached regarding the boat's main components, the keel and the hull. Professor Fang Xin had contacted them several times, and the response was always: "Still analyzing, please don't worry."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba wanted to wait, but the situation did not permit it. The team members were more anxious than he was. Lü Jingnan, Master Yala, and Master Tashi were worried about delays, and with so many people discussing matters, if the news leaked out, their opponents might reach Shambhala before them. Wang You and Sean were somewhat impatient, just like Zhuo Mu Qiangba after completing his initial training before heading to the Americas. Everyone believed they had reached an unprecedented level of strength and were confident to test their skills. Zhang Li and Yue Yang had also completed the assembly and modification of their equipment. Zhuo Mu Qiangba and Tang Min had not made any breakthroughs in their historical research. It seemed that all the necessary preparations were completed, and they were just waiting for the final departure.

Finally, a more serious problem arose: Zhuo Mu Qiangba's body began to show abnormalities. Tang Min was the first to discover it. Zhuo Mu Qiangba's back developed pinpoint-sized red spots. Initially, they didn't pay much attention, but later, these small red spots became increasingly numerous and noticeable, showing a tendency to merge into a single red patch. However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba himself felt no discomfort. Tang Min quickly informed Master Yala. The two masters, accompanied by Master Tashi, came to examine Zhuo Mu Qiangba's condition. Finally, both masters unanimously agreed that they could not delay any further and must depart immediately. This proposal was supported by seven out of the nine team members. Thus, without waiting for the results of the boat hull and keel analysis, they prepared to depart.

The departure time for Motuo was set. The day before departure, Zhuo Mu Qiangba gathered all the team members on the training ground. Looking at the unfamiliar faces, Zhuo Mu Qiangba felt a pang in his heart: "These people have absolutely no connection to me. What kind of force makes them fearless of death and boldly challenge the unknown god of death!" He quietly asked Yue Yang, "Are they really ready to depart? Is everything really okay?"

Yue Yang assured him, "Don't worry, Young Master Qiangba. They have all undergone special training."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood on a high rock platform and asked for the last time, "Tomorrow, we depart! I will now, for the last time, explain to you all: we are not going on an adventure, because calling what we are about to face an adventure is too frivolous. We are declaring war on the god of death. We are undertaking an impossible mission; we are challenging the extreme of the extreme. Moreover, this challenge is only the beginning. What we will encounter besides death, no one can be certain. But death is definitely something we will face. I cannot guarantee or assure you of anything. Therefore, I hope you will consider this very carefully. We have no turning back. Once the boat sails into the darkness, we will directly face the god of death. Please make a choice between your future lives and your yearning for the sacred land. Perhaps this will be your last choice in life. Everyone, I am very grateful for your selfless help. I am also truly impressed by your dedication and perseverance. But I am not trying to scare you; I just don't want to see meaningless sacrifices. If you have even a shred of attachment to this world, for the sake of your family and friends, please choose to give up. This is your last chance!"

A silence fell over the crowd below. The wind in the sunlight carried a hint of chill. Wang You loudly responded, "From the first day I stepped into this place, I made my choice. Whether in the past, present, or future, this is my unwavering answer!"

As he responded, others chimed in one after another, all with expressions of heroic sacrifice and righteous indignation. Meng Haoran, inspired by the poetry, recited:

> I do not wish to spend my life on the plains,
> Though the plains are flat and free from hardship,
> They lack the thrill of climbing high mountains.
> I do not wish to drift with the stagnant waters of life,
> Though stagnant waters are calm and free from hidden reefs,
> They lack the spirit of conquering the ocean.
> Every moment, every hour,
> I am always escaping,
> Escaping unnoticed, mediocre love,
> Escaping day after day of false happiness,
> Escaping tender care filled with traps,
> Escaping pitiless, compassionate gazes.
> To escape, I long and pursue,
> I long to cross the mountains of the heart,
> To catch a glimpse of the alluring scenery beyond the mountains.
> To escape, I long and pursue,
> I pursue crossing the great sea of dreams,
> To catch a glimpse of the leaping clouds and sails beyond the sea.
> To fulfill the vows issued by instinct,
> My life becomes real from this moment on.
> I truly feel pain,
> Because the distant sacred fire burns my persistence.
> I truly feel loss,
> Because what lies before me is not what I imagined.
> But I no longer wish to turn back,
> Because I have tasted,
> The joy of a wounded wolf licking its bloody wound.

After hearing the entire poem, Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't help but admire the talent of this refined adventure photographer and asked, "Did you write this?"

Meng Haoran adjusted his glasses' nose clip and shook his head, "It seems to be written by a university president."

At this moment, Lü Jingnan handed a file bag to Zhuo Mu Qiangba, saying, "This is for you."

"What is it?"

Lü Jingnan replied, "This stack is the signed disclaimer statements from everyone here. These envelopes contain the last wills."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "We never did this before!"

Captain Hu Yang stated, "It was Wang You's suggestion. Very professional. I recommend you sign one too. Better safe than sorry. If anything happens, at least there's an explanation. Give this to those who remain. I've signed one before; this is my seventh last will."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba picked up the file bag and asked, "Has everyone signed?" Peeking through the plastic film, he continued, "Huh? Minmin also wrote one? When?"

Tang Min hurriedly said, "No peeking!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba chuckled, "Okay, we'll read it when we get back." Tang Min insisted, "You're not allowed to read it even when we get back!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba hesitated slightly. Tang Min grabbed his hand and pleaded, "Please don't read it, okay?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba had no choice but to agree.

Lü Jingnan added, "You should sign one too."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "I won't sign. We will definitely return safely. Let the mentor keep these." Thinking of Professor Fang Xin, his expression dimmed slightly.

Yue Yang and Zhang Li chimed in, "Support Young Master Qiangba! We haven't written them either!"

"Why haven't you written them?"

Yue Yang responded, "We will definitely return." The young man's face turned towards the sun, revealing a radiant smile.

Zhang Li added, "If he's not writing, why should I?"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng and Li Hong chuckled and patted Yue Yang's head, saying, "Look, it's just like before, full of confidence."

Yue Yang retorted, "Get lost! Don't think you can reach my level just by training for a few days. You're still far off..."

"Oh, you're boasting, aren't you?"

"Don't believe me? Don't believe us? Let's have a competition?" "A competition it is, who's afraid of whom?" "How should we compete?" "Come on, come on, let's compete over here..."

By evening, Zhuo Mu Qiangba found himself unable to sleep. Minmin was drawing circles on his chest with her finger. Zhuo Mu Qiangba sighed deeply, "Why aren't you sleeping yet, Minmin?"

Tang Min replied, "How can I sleep? You aren't sleeping either."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba agreed, "Yes, after experiencing so much, I still can't sleep thinking about departing tomorrow. This time, we will definitely find the Paba La Temple. I have a strong premonition."

Tang Min leaned against Zhuo Mu Qiangba's chest and said, "Mmm, after we heal your injuries, we'll go to Croatia."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba deliberately feigned forgetfulness, "Go to Croatia? What are we going there for?"

Tang Min pouted, "You promised someone you'd buy an island there! Oh, you never took it to heart, you were just trying to make me happy!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba smiled and said, "How could I? This time we go, not only will we find the Paba La Temple, but more importantly, we will definitely find the Purple Qilin. Minmin, do you think there really is such a thing as fate in this world? Seeing the photo of the Purple Qilin seems like it happened just yesterday. Two years have passed in a flash. If it weren't for that photo, how would I have met you?"

"Mmm," Tang Min seemed to recall the sweetness of their first meeting and buried her head in Zhuo Mu Qiangba's chest, deeply.

### 第三节 离别

The next morning dawned bright and sunny. Zhuo Mu Qiangba, Tang Min, Captain Hu Yang, Master Yala, Lü Jingnan, Zhang Li, Yue Yang, Basang, and other veteran team members gathered in Professor Fang Xin's room. They had come to bid farewell to the professor.

A ray of sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the living room brightly. The professor shook hands firmly with each team member. A moment of silence followed, as they didn't know what to say. They had experienced life and death together. If it weren't for the professor's physical condition being unsuitable for further risks, or if Zhuo Mu Qiangba's life wasn't hanging by a thread, they would have waited for Professor Fang Xin's leg injury to heal before traveling together. Within the entire team, everyone could see that the person who stayed up the latest, consulting and organizing information under the lamp, was none other than the elderly Professor Fang Xin. When everyone else was resting, the person who was busy communicating with experts, constantly on video calls and dialogues, was none other than the white-haired Professor Fang Xin. When they encountered insurmountable obstacles or unsolvable riddles on their path forward, the person who provided guidance and clarity was the erudite Professor Fang Xin. Everyone knew how Professor's erudition and knowledge came about, and they all admired and were grateful to him from the bottom of their hearts, especially Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Before these team members even knew each other, the mentor had already been working towards finding Paba La. The mentor was that kind of person: once he set his mind to something, he would absolutely commit 100%, even if he broke his leg and was in a wheelchair, he never stopped working passionately. If anyone were to say that the mentor had sacrificed the most for this expedition to Paba La, no one would dare to deny it. However, now that the expedition was truly about to begin, Professor Fang Xin could only sit in his wheelchair, like a benevolent elder, looking kindly at his departing children, smiling at each team member.

Yue Yang was the first to step forward, holding the professor's hand, and said, "Professor, thank you."

"Oh, what are you thanking me for?" Professor Fang Xin asked with a smile.

Yue Yang replied, "You taught me so many things that I will use my entire life. So, thank you—" As he spoke, his voice changed.

Zhang Li interrupted, "Alright, you're not a child. You can't even say a few farewell words properly. We're not going for long; maybe we'll finish in a week or two and be back soon. Don't you think so, Professor?"

Professor Fang Xin smiled and said, "Of course. I hope you succeed quickly."

Zhang Li added, "Professor, after we depart, will you keep an eye on that matter for me?"

Professor Fang Xin hesitated, "You mean...? Oh... I understand!" Zhang Li whispered into the professor's ear, "You know, always being with Young Master Qiangba, I'm still single. Look at this..."

Professor Fang Xin chuckled, "Understood, understood. Let me, a professor, help you consider this matter. However, I study dogs, so my aesthetic judgment has been neglected for a long time. If it's not what you expect, don't blame me, haha." Professor Fang Xin stopped smiling, patted Zhang Li's arm, and nodded, "Young man, you should consider it. Even for your mother—"

Mentioning his mother, Zhang Li immediately recalled his mother standing at the doorway when he left home, just like when he was a child, always straightening his collar, personally handing him his backpack, and after helping him put it on, patting his hair and brushing dust off his sleeves and cuffs, then looking at her tall son standing before her with apparent satisfaction.

"Mom, I'm leaving."

His mother nodded, that kind and satisfied smile always the most beautiful smile in her son's eyes. He counted his steps, and after walking twenty steps, his mother's familiar call sounded behind him again: "Son, come back soon!" It was this call, accompanying him throughout his youth since childhood, that always warmed his heart, no matter when. Twenty steps, never one more, never one less. Each time, listening to this call with a mix of longing and reluctance, he immediately replied loudly, "Got it, Mom!" And he secretly vowed, "Mom, this is your son's last time leaving. From now on, I will never travel far from you again. Your son will definitely find a good wife, and we'll buy a big house in the city..."

Thinking of this, Zhang Li looked at Professor Fang Xin's gentle smile and suddenly felt as if he were looking at his mother. His nose twitched, and he couldn't help but turn his head away, standing beside Yue Yang.

Basang was the third to shake hands with Professor Fang Xin. He looked at the professor for a long time, his facial expression relaxing slightly, and said, "You are a warrior, Professor."

The professor's grip was unusually firm, and he stared at Basang, saying, "You must protect them!"

Basang hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. He noticed that the old man's hand, as he held Basang's, trembled slightly from excessive force. Was this a plea or a warning? Professor Fang Xin had already looked away, but his hand still tightly held Basang's, his gaze fixed on the hem of Basang's clothes. "Don't forget what you promised your brother!" Basang trembled slightly, then nodded heavily. Only then did the professor nod and release his hand. Basang turned and patted Zhuo Mu Qiangba's shoulder forcefully, saying nothing.

Tang Min, with red eyes, walked up to Professor Fang Xin. The professor smiled kindly and said, "When you go out this time, you must protect Qiangbala properly! He's very careless and not meticulous enough, easily getting hurt. With you, a medical staff member, accompanying him, I feel relieved."

Tang Min hugged the professor's neck and began to sob. The professor patted her back and said to Tang Min, "You still haven't changed this bad habit. Don't cry. It's not like we'll be gone for long. Just come visit me when we get back."

Large tears streamed down Tang Min's face. "It's all my fault. If I hadn't told you about your health condition every time we met, Professor... Professor, you too... *sob sob sob*..."

Professor Fang Xin recalled when Tang Min first argued with him about going together to find the Paba La Temple, and he couldn't help but laugh heartily, "Silly girl, you still remember that? Haha."

Captain Hu Yang stated, "Old Fang, let's not be sentimental, you and I. I hope you'll be recovered by the time we return, and then we can climb snow mountains together."

Professor Fang Xin chuckled and replied, "Okay!" He then took Captain Hu Yang's hand and said, "You have extensive outdoor experience. With you around, I feel reassured."

Captain Hu Yang looked at him with a smile, his hands firm and powerful.

Master Yala did not shake hands with the professor but clasped his hands together and uttered a mantra, "All phenomena arise from causes and conditions; to follow causes is blessings."

Professor Fang Xin happily understood and suddenly asked in a low voice, "I know this temple holds extraordinary significance for your religious circles, but I still have to ask, Master, is your all-out involvement truly just for religious faith? Or...?"

Master Yala leaned down and whispered something in Professor Fang Xin's ear. Professor Fang Xin's expression became solemn, and he looked up at Master Yala, asking, "Is it true?" txt Novel Paradise Online Bookstore Update http://www.xiaoshuotxt.com/』『E-book Download http://txt.xiaoshuotxt.com/』http://www.huanhun.com/

Master Yala nodded solemnly. Professor Fang Xin relaxed his brow and smiled slightly, "Good, that's good."

The master's voice was so low that Yue Yang couldn't hear anything even when straining his ears. Later, Yue Yang repeatedly asked the master what exactly he had said to the professor, but the master consistently refused to answer.

Lü Jingnan also did not shake hands with the professor. Instead, she brought her legs together and gave a standard military salute. Professor Fang Xin said, "You are their instructor. With you in this team, there is discipline. For any mischievous individuals, please take care of them." As he spoke, he glanced at Zhuo Mu Qiangba and shook his head slightly.

Lü Jingnan replied, "For the past two years, I have followed your request for humane management. Where is there any discipline left? If we are talking about discipline, it will depend on how our new captain manages." Saying this, she gave Zhuo Mu Qiangba a meaningful glance.

Everyone stood facing the doorway, leaving only Zhuo Mu Qiangba. He stood there silently, contemplating this elder, this mentor. The deep wrinkles etched on his forehead, the deep imprints left by the eyeglass frames on his nose bridge, the sunken eye sockets making his eyes appear small and narrow. Those eyes, those eyes were also covered by a layer of dimness, not as bright and spirited as before. This was his mentor! The one who had taught him about canids hand-in-hand and changed his life. Sometimes Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't distinguish whether this was his teacher or his father. Only when he truly calmed down and observed carefully, in this moment of parting, did he suddenly realize that he had grown old.

Professor Fang Xin beckoned Zhuo Mu Qiangba to come closer, to his side. Zhuo Mu Qiangba moved his feet and approached Professor Fang Xin, kneeling like a medieval knight, looking up slightly so that the professor could look him in the eye. "Mentor—" Looking at the professor's calm, loving face, Zhuo Mu Qiangba suddenly didn't know what to say. He only heard Professor Fang Xin say, "I understand your intentions. We don't need to say much between us. It's just that I need you to know my wishes."

"Mmm, tell me, mentor. I'm listening." Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked up at the professor.

Professor Fang Xin gently placed his hand on Zhuo Mu Qiangba's head and said earnestly, "Remember, Qiangbala, you are the captain. You must bear the responsibility of a captain. The lives of all the team members are in your hands. And this time, we all understand what lies ahead. I hope you not only find the temple safely but, more importantly, that all of you return safely!" The professor looked at everyone and then added, "Especially, the people in this room, do you understand? They are not just your team members. Having gone through the line of death together, you relied on mutual trust and cooperation to escape the clutches of death. For the past two years, they have been your closest comrades. You could even say you are a family of different surnames!"

"Remember!" The professor emphasized, "Family means no one is abandoned, no one is forgotten! Do you understand!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba clearly felt the force in the professor's arm transmitted to his head as he spoke. This was a pressure, or perhaps a responsibility. He replied firmly, "I understand, mentor."

Professor Fang Xin released his hand, sighing with relief as if shedding a burden. He took a key from his pocket, removed a Swiss Army knife made entirely of steel from the keychain, and solemnly handed it to Zhuo Mu Qiangba, saying, "I can't go with you this time. Take this. Don't mind that it's old; it might come in handy sometimes."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba accepted this gift with both hands. He knew the significance of this Swiss Army knife in Professor Fang Xin's heart, just like his own family heirloom, a small bronze sword pendant. This was the most precious gift Professor Fang Xin had received from his father as a child. For over fifty years, it had never left the professor's side. In the stories the professor recounted, he had survived countless desperate situations thanks to this small army knife. Now, this small knife was passed into his hands. Zhuo Mu Qiangba clearly realized that what the mentor was entrusting him with was not just a small knife; the mentor hoped to pass on his spirit of fearless exploration and inquiry to him through this small knife.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at Professor Fang Xin with sparkling eyes, and Professor Fang Xin looked back at him, smiling. The wrinkles etched by time were deeply piled on the old man's face, and the frost-dyed temples extended upwards from his ears. This old man knew clearly that time took everything away. Even if his leg injury healed, he would no longer be able to climb great snowy mountains or traverse vast deserts and grasslands as before. However, the adventure journey would continue. Qiangbala, please carry my gaze and observe this entirely new and unfamiliar world. This was the message the old man conveyed to Zhuo Mu Qiangba through his eyes.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba suppressed his surging emotions and handed the file bag to Professor Fang Xin, saying, "Mentor, these are everyone's disclaimers and last wills. Please keep them for now."

Professor Fang Xin smiled and replied, "Okay. I hope I never have to open them." He looked out the window, where the majestic figures of distant snowy mountains could be seen. The snow-covered peaks silently overlooked all living beings on earth. The professor remarked, "I think by the time the snow lotus blooms, you should be back, right?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba nodded, "Yes, when the snow lotus blooms, we will definitely be back." The two smiled slightly; they had made an agreement. The professor then said, "Alright, hurry up and go. The car is waiting for you."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and gave Professor Fang Xin a final, affectionate gaze. He forced back the sourness welling up in his heart, saying, "Then, we're leaving, mentor." After speaking, he turned and strode away without looking back, firm and persistent.

"We're leaving, Professor."

"Goodbye, Old Fang, wait for our good news."

"We'll be back soon..."

"Goodbye, Professor..."

"Goodbye, Professor..."

The car left a trail of dust on the road. As it drove far away, Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked back and could still see Professor Fang Xin waving at the doorway, like clouds bidding farewell in the western sky. The thin figure in the wheelchair seemed to grow closer as the distance increased.

All the way, Zhuo Mu Qiangba kept caressing the steel knife. Every scratch and mark on its blade told stories of Professor Fang Xin's youthful journeys. Perhaps, one day, when he himself became too old to walk, this small knife would be held tightly in the hands of another young person, witnessing another miraculous journey. "The paths we've walked, no one knows. The deeds we've done, no one records. But this small knife, just this small knife, can it silently feel?" He pondered this so deeply that he missed many sights that Tang Min was excitedly pointing out.

As the car reached Paixiang, the road ended. The group got out of the car, and the backpackers shouldered their heavy luggage again, pursuing the hope of freedom, taking firm steps towards the wilderness where modern civilization could not reach. Countless unknowns awaited them ahead, some even requiring them to pay with their lives. But everyone smiled and moved forward without hesitation, because they were moving forward with hope and aspirations. The beauty before them had already overshadowed the fear of danger, or even death.

On the first day, the team members traveled at full speed, crossing mountains and ridges to reach the bank of the Brahmaputra River. Seeing the winding white dragon, the team members who were seeing the Brahmaputra River for the first time were filled with excitement. As they fell asleep to the roaring sound, their hearts surged like the Brahmaputra River. On the second day, they began to navigate the suspended paths along the river. For the new team members who had never walked such cliffside paths next to the river, it was quite unsettling. They often felt a pounding heart for a while at treacherous sections. To ensure safety, the team's progress was slowed down, but they managed to reach the first stone hollow for camping before dark. The following three days passed without major incident amidst the shouts of the new team members. On the fourth day, they entered the most treacherous rapid section of the Brahmaputra River that had never been navigated before. Ascending upstream, Yue Yang retrieved the monitoring devices placed along the route and conducted simple recording and analysis. Later that day, the entire team safely crossed the Great Liusuo and entered the Gongbu Village area. After Zhuo Mu Qiangba consulted with some of the veteran team members, they decided not to return to Gongbu Village to stay overnight due to the distance and the late hour, opting for wild camping. They would be able to reach the Gate of Hell directly the next day.

The bonfire blazed, illuminating the faces of the team members. Captain Hu Yang, Master Yala, and Master Tashi discussed something while drawing lines on the ground. Lü Jingnan stood by, listening. Yue Yang was busy collecting and organizing his monitoring data. His two comrades occasionally bothered him but were soon captivated by Zhang Li's embellished account of their first mysterious experience in Gongbu Village. Although they had heard it many times at the training camp, now that they were on-site, listening to Zhang Li's mysterious and embellished storytelling, it had a different flavor. Meng Haoran, too, was engrossed. Besides fiddling with his camera, he also placed something hard beneath him and buried himself in note-taking. Walking along the Brahmaputra River these past few days had already inspired the poet, making him write furiously every night before he could rest.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba sat beside Minmin but paid no attention to Zhang Li's boastful talk. Gazing at the dark green mountains, he pondered the unresolved mysteries. He knew clearly that those mysteries could become the biggest obstacles for their expedition. If they couldn't figure them out for even a day, it would cause them worry for days.

"Young Master Qiangba, come here." Yue Yang waved at him.

### 第四节 未知的行程

Zhuo Mu Qiangba approached Yue Yang. Yue Yang pointed to Professor Fang Xin's laptop and said, "Look, this is the computer's simulation analysis based on the data from the monitoring devices we placed. See this time period? This line represents the peak water volume."

"Hmm?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "Does this mean the Brahmaputra River truly rises at night?"

Yue Yang replied, "I don't think so. Young Master Qiangba, look, this is the data from the No. 1 measuring instrument, and this is from No. 2. The results from No. 1 to No. 5 all show a significant increase in water level. However, if you look closely at this set of data, the extent of the water level increase at each point is different, showing a gradually decreasing trend. By the No. 6 monitoring point, the measured water level is almost the same as the normal level. The No. 7 to No. 13 monitoring points are all at normal heights. However, the No. 14 measuring instrument, look..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed in surprise, "It's so much higher!"

Yue Yang confirmed, "Exactly. The water flow and velocity have significantly increased, reaching twice the water volume of the same period. Between the No. 14 and No. 24 monitoring points, there is again a gradual decreasing trend. By the No. 25 monitoring point, it has returned to normal water volume. And it increased suddenly around 12:20 AM. This is illogical."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "Indeed. The water volume increases segmentally and suddenly. How is this possible?"

Yue Yang explained, "After repeated computer simulations, only one situation can cause this phenomenon."

"What situation?"

"The increase in water volume is not due to the Brahmaputra River itself. The water is coming from elsewhere and is backflowing into the Brahmaputra River through channels like the Gate of Hell. Due to the uneven distribution of the outlets, the Brahmaputra River's night water level experiences segmental surges."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba frowned and asked, "How can this be?"

Yue Yang elaborated, "Although we don't know the reason yet, Young Master Qiangba, think about that cowhide boat. Stuck at such a height, if the underground river's water level truly rose to that height, it must have been far above the Brahmaputra River's water level. It's not strange for the underground river water to backflow into the Brahmaputra River. The strangeness is only how the underground river water could rise so high. Ah!" Yue Yang suddenly realized, "No wonder we didn't see any traces of water erosion inside the underground river tunnels. If it could rise to the position of the cowhide boat, it would have almost filled the entire lava tunnel, so naturally, there would be no water lines."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba inquired, "If the water is backflowing from the underground river, where does that water come from? It fills the underground river channel almost completely in a short time. Does such a phenomenon exist in nature?"

Yue Yang replied, "I don't know. But I do have a method to simply determine if our inference is correct."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "Oh, what method?"

Yue Yang pointed to the computer and said, "Young Master Qiangba, look. If the Brahmaputra River's water level isn't rising on its own, but the underground river is backflowing into the Brahmaputra River through channels like the Gate of Hell entrance, then near the No. 14 monitoring point, there should be a channel similar to the Gate of Hell entrance. We only need to take a few people to check it to confirm our inference."

Seeing that Zhuo Mu Qiangba did not answer immediately, Yue Yang added, "I only need Zhang Li and Brother Basang to help. We'll set off early tomorrow morning. Once confirmed, we'll immediately catch up with the main group." Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Remember to maintain contact and be careful." Yue Yang went off happily to discuss this with Zhang Li and Basang. Zhuo Mu Qiangba then called Professor Fang Xin and informed him of this information. While traveling, Zhuo Mu Qiangba maintained daily contact with the professor, exchanging information. The closer they got to the Gate of Hell, the longer their phone calls became. He knew that after this departure, the Styx River would separate them by thousands of years, and their return date was uncertain.

The next day, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Basang, and others turned south, while Zhuo Mu Qiangba led the remaining team members north. Midway, he received a call from Yue Yang. Yue Yang said on the phone, "Young Master Qiangba, the inference has been confirmed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "What did you say! There really is a passage there?"

Yue Yang replied, "Yes, but it's not marked on the map because it's a sieve-like passage with many entrances, each only the size of a fist. We used a camera to probe it and found that the tunnels inside are equally narrow. I'll explain when I get back. In any case, this entrance is unusable."

Standing on the platform of the Gate of Hell, Meng Haoran sighed, "Flying stream straight down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way falls from nine heavens..."

Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent natural scenery, as beautiful as a fairy land in a painting, like an illusion in a dream. The silver ribbon was slightly larger than when they had last visited, its momentum increasingly majestic. Below the cliff face, the waves churned like ten thousand galloping horses, charging forward relentlessly, evoking the sentiment of "Yellow River water comes from the heavens, flowing to the sea and never returning."

Li Hong cautiously asked Master Yala, who had been there before, "Why don't I see the gate?"

Master Yala stared at the rolling waves below and replied, "It's in the water."

"Ah!" Li Hong looked down the cliff face. Whirlpools passed one after another beneath their feet. Just watching them was dizzying. Such turbulent currents, even if an iron bull fell in, would disappear without a trace!

While Meng Haoran was lost in his poetic fervor, Li Dingming seized his SLR camera and began taking pictures.

Minmin, who was also not visiting for the first time, was captivated by a beautiful butterfly on Lü Jingnan's shoulder. The butterfly's wings fluttered slowly in the sunlight, but its few feet were firmly stuck to Lü Jingnan's shoulder, not leaving even when he shook his shoulders to capture the scenery.

Tang Min curiously asked, "Brother Dingming, when did this butterfly fly here? Why isn't it leaving?"

Li Dingming looked and smiled, "I don't know why. Since childhood, I've always attracted butterflies. Every time I went on an outing, a group of butterflies followed me. My daughter is the same; all the children affectionately call her Butterfly Princess. When I came out this time, I promised her I'd bring back the most beautiful butterfly I'd never seen."

While Li Dingming and Tang Min were talking, Master Yala and Master Tashi glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, "Contracted!" Both masters had the same thought flash through their minds.

After resting on the platform for a while, Yue Yang and the others returned, panting. After reviewing their video data, Zhuo Mu Qiangba fed this information back to Professor Fang Xin. The professor said, "I consulted some experts overnight. Their explanation is that if a channel between a lake in the mountains and an underground river suddenly opens up, depending on the size and water capacity of the lake, it could cause some underground river channels to surge. However, this situation should only occur occasionally and not every night. If the monitoring devices Yue Yang placed recorded consistently abundant water levels at night for the past half-month, then we can only look for other reasons. If we rush into the underground river without clarifying this issue, the danger is still considerable."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "I understand. I will observe tonight, but no matter what, we must depart tomorrow morning."

Professor Fang Xin replied, "I know. Please be extremely careful."

Upon reaching the platform, it was already evening. According to the plan, everyone would rest on the platform for the night, and after recuperating, they would depart early the next morning. Zhuo Mu Qiangba would also take the opportunity to observe the mystery of the Brahmaputra River's nocturnal rise in this area. The team members set up their tents. Yue Yang and Basang, along with three new team members, hunted some wild game and returned triumphantly. A wooden frame was erected on the platform, and the aroma of roasted meat began to waft.

A cool breeze blew, and the starry sky was dotted with stars, shimmering like scattered jewels under the starlight. The great river rushed forward, sounding like ten thousand drums beating in unison, ten thousand thunders erupting simultaneously. It was indeed a good place to camp. Everyone sat around the bonfire, tearing and eating roasted meat. Each person was cheerful, and laughter occasionally drifted through the valley. Meng Haoran's poetic inspiration surged again, and he recited, "In the heavens and on earth, homeland of colorful clouds. Holding wine against the wind, our hearts are stirred. As the sun sets in the west, I will engrave this wondrous human landscape with my eyes... into my chest. When did it happen! When did it happen... have I ever been so frenzied! The silver dragon of the nine heavens flows beneath my feet. The cool wind of the empty valley accompanies my song. Ah, I want to dance, I am already crazy! Come, friends, let's dance the joyous pot dance, let's release our boundless joy! Ah! Paradise on earth, magical place! Ah!..." Zhao Zhuang Sheng stuffed a leg of meat into his mouth, abruptly cutting off Meng Haoran's unfinished verse. "Stop 'ah-ing' there; it's spoiling my appetite." Everyone laughed heartily.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba listened to a few jokes from Zhang Li, quietly got up, and went to the edge of the platform. There, Basang was already half-soaked by the mist from the waterfall. "Young Master Qiangba." Basang answered without turning his head, staring at the flying waterfall. He stood at the very edge of the cliff. A slight slip beneath his feet would send him into the abyss, and the turbulent river water would surely sweep him away without a trace. However, Basang stood with his hands in his pockets, motionless, as if rooted to the cliff edge.

"Ah." Zhuo Mu Qiangba walked over and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Basang, even stepping further forward than Basang, with half of his shoe soles hanging over the edge, equally unshakeable. He tilted his head slightly, his gaze passing over the waterfall and extending towards the distant, yet shining, starlight. "You still don't like being with so many people? Look, everyone is quite happy."

Basang sneered, "Hmph. We don't know if we'll be alive or dead tomorrow, what's there to be happy about?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exhaled the turbid air in his chest and patted Basang's shoulder, "Whether we live or die tomorrow is something to consider tomorrow. At least now they are happy. Perhaps, among them, you might find the happiness you've been trying to find. Why don't you try experiencing it?"

Basang tilted his head back, but saw that the bright moon in the sky was somewhat dim, and a few sparse stars twinkled faintly far from the moon. He mumbled vaguely, "The moon is dim and the stars are few; it's not a good omen."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba led Basang back to the circle around the bonfire. That night, everyone sang and danced to their hearts' content. Basang even smiled with less coldness several times.

Deep in the night, after everyone had fallen asleep, Zhuo Mu Qiangba was still watching at the edge of the platform. Yue Yang was also there. They were waiting for the river water below the platform to rise. The night breeze grew stronger, adding a touch of coolness to the deep night. Yue Yang pulled his collar tighter and said, "Young Master Qiangba, why don't you go rest? You have to lead everyone boating tomorrow. If I notice any changes, I'll photograph them, and you can see them tomorrow morning."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "No, it's better to see it myself. Filming only captures one frame, and perhaps some details might be overlooked. Besides, if we don't figure out this issue, how can I dare take so many new team members on the water tomorrow? I can't sleep."

Yue Yang nodded, "That's true..."

After a moment, Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "Yue Yang, aren't you on a mission? Is it okay to be out like this? Aren't your family members worried?"

Yue Yang smiled, "What's there to worry about? I have many older brothers and sisters above me. I've been wild since I was little. I wasn't good at studying and often ran away from home; I was definitely the type to bring shame to my family. I think my family sent me to the army because they couldn't handle me anymore."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at Yue Yang and chuckled, "I wouldn't have thought so."

Yue Yang straightened his clothes, saying, "Really? After thinking about it, he looked up at the starry sky with a sigh, "Actually, Zhang Li shouldn't have come. His father passed away early, and his mother raised him alone. He's also an only child. However..." He shook his head, "Trying to persuade him is futile; he's very determined."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's heart skipped a beat. All along, he had intentionally avoided prying into these people's family backgrounds, even avoiding them to some extent. He didn't know why, but subconsciously, he explained it by "trusting those you employ, not doubting those you trust," although he knew it wasn't entirely true.

At this moment, a strange sound startled the two of them. The sound seemed to come directly from the sheer cliff face opposite them, like muffled thunder, the low roar of a giant beast, seeming both far away and very close. Zhuo Mu Qiangba decisively said, "Searchlight, shine it down there."

Under the powerful light, the two were astonished to see that the entire Brahmaputra River below the platform seemed to be boiling. Beneath the constantly churning waves, countless bubbles emerged. However, the roaring sound of the water completely masked the sound of the bubbles bursting. If they hadn't been deliberately watching, they wouldn't have discovered this strange phenomenon. Yue Yang exclaimed, "Young Master Qiangba, look! The marker!" Under the illumination of the searchlight, the red markers Yue Yang had painted on the opposite cliff face during the day were being swallowed by the river water bit by bit. However, upstream of the Gate of Hell, the markers remained intact. The further downstream they went, the higher the water rose.

The entire process lasted about ten minutes, after which the water level maintained a certain balance and then slowly began to recede. Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't help but be horrified, "It seems the underground river water doesn't rise slowly but fills up instantly. What... what kind of phenomenon is this?" Yue Yang also shook his head in confusion.

Suddenly, the two fell silent, as if by unspoken agreement. Zhuo Mu Qiangba gestured silently to Yue Yang, "Someone is following us. Only one person. Let's not alert everyone yet. You go east, and I'll circle around from the west."

The two turned away tacitly, as if returning to their respective tents, but only to use the tents to conceal their movements before disappearing into the darkness. The next moment, Zhuo Mu Qiangba had already appeared beside a tree on the platform edge, while Yue Yang was well-hidden in another location within his line of sight.

The approaching person clearly lacked tracking experience; their footsteps were hurried, and the sound was loud. Zhuo Mu Qiangba suddenly appeared, seizing the person with a flick of his wrist and controlling them, while simultaneously asking in a low voice, "Who are you?"

The approaching person was clearly terrified and weak. Startled by Zhuo Mu Qiangba, they couldn't speak and didn't dare to cry out. Zhuo Mu Qiangba only heard the sound of their trembling inhales. Zhuo Mu Qiangba also felt that the hand he held had slender bones, not like a man's arm. In the dim light, he saw a pair of large eyes filled with terror but also brightness. "Gaga!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba released his grip, astonished, "How did you get here?"

Gaga also recovered from her fear and gradually recognized Zhuo Mu Qiangba's appearance and voice, carefully saying, "Holy... Holy Envoy!"

Yue Yang also rushed over. Upon seeing Gaga, he was equally surprised, "Gaga!"

"How did you find your way here?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, while leading Gaga towards the bonfire. The little girl's clothes were disheveled, and her face and cheeks were covered in dust and scratches. He couldn't help but ask, "How did you get like this?"

Gaga started crying before speaking, "Finally found you, Holy Envoy. This..." As she spoke, she took out the Dzi bead that Zhuo Mu Qiangba had entrusted to Doji from her bosom, rubbed it for a long time, and finally handed it out, saying, "This is what Doji left behind. Please take it to Shambhala, Holy Envoy. Doji's greatest wish in his life was to accompany the Holy Envoy to find the sacred land in his heart—"

The little girl's hands trembled as she held the Dzi bead. This was perhaps the only tangible item Doji had left behind. Whether to keep it with her or let the Holy Envoy take it to Shambhala, the little girl had clearly struggled internally for a long time.

"Just for this, you traveled over mountains and crossed valleys to find us..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't help but blame her slightly.

"Mmm!" Unexpectedly, determination flashed in Gaga's eyes, clearly indicating that for her, this was an extremely important matter.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba said, "It's so late, and you're just a little girl wandering in the mountains. Aren't you afraid of being eaten by wild beasts? Does your brother know? You... you're really being reckless."

Yue Yang brought some food and asked, "Have you eaten? Are you hungry?" Gaga thanked him and took the food and water to eat. The little girl was clearly very hungry.

Gaga explained, "After the Holy Envoy left, Brother Zhang brought more equipment. I knew the Holy Envoy would definitely come back. This time, we are truly setting off, and I was afraid of missing the time. I've been looking for you these past few days..."

As Gaga spoke while eating, she revealed that ever since she decided to have the Holy Envoy take Doji's Dzi bead to Shambhala, she had been searching for the Gate of Hell. However, Zhang Li and his team had already left by then. Although the Gate of Hell was a sacred place guarded by the people of Gongbu Village, not everyone knew its location. Gaga knew her brother wouldn't tell her the entrance to the Gate of Hell. She thought that since the Holy Envoy cared so much about her brother three years ago, the Gate of Hell must be somewhere near where she found her brother, so she had been searching and waiting in that vicinity. Seeing the firelight on the other side of the mountain today, Gaga had rushed over.

After listening to Gaga's account and looking at the dust-covered little girl, Zhuo Mu Qiangba and Yue Yang were speechless. It was too dangerous to send her back now. Gaga said it wasn't necessary; she could find her way back to the village during the day. Zhuo Mu Qiangba arranged for Gaga to share a tent with Lü Jingnan. After settling the little girl, he and Yue Yang also went to rest.

Early the next morning, Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked if they needed to escort Gaga back. The stubborn and resilient little girl politely declined, saying she wanted to stay and guard until the Holy Envoy departed, to personally witness the Holy Envoy enter the Gate of Hell.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba called his mentor again. The two discussed the unresolved questions, seemingly without mentioning the departure. The professor gave mostly instructions and expressed concern. Finally, Zhuo Mu Qiangba said, "Mentor, I need to hang up now. Everyone is waiting for me."

Professor Fang Xin's final words were, "Then I won't say much more. Remember! Family means no one is abandoned, and no one is forgotten!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba echoed in unison, "Family means no one is abandoned, and no one is forgotten." He closed his phone, pulled the zipper of his integrated diving suit, and began climbing down the rope. Yue Yang and Captain Hu Yang were responsible for clearing the traces afterwards.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba floated on the water, looking up at the blue sky and white clouds. After a moment, only the long darkness would accompany him. He thought to himself, suddenly, Gaga's clear and melodious singing erupted from the banks, her voice long and trembling, overwhelming the roar of the waterfall, clearly reaching the ears of every team member. Chu Yan, who had not studied ancient Tibetan, couldn't help but ask, "What is she singing? It sounds very sad."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied indifferently, "It's a farewell song." After speaking, he took a deep breath and sank his body downwards. The hazy sound of water filled his ears, muffling everything else. The platform suddenly became like a silent, empty valley, with only the lingering melody echoing: "Above the Styx River, souls cry out; flowers bloom on the other shore, sorrow on this shore..." www.xiaoshuotxt.com t××xt×小×说××天×堂

## 第四十七章 向下朝香巴拉前进

All the equipment was packed into waterproof plastic bags and sent into the underground river. The team members then crossed the narrow rapid channel by climbing along the underwater ropes. Zhang Li and Master Yala were stationed at the source of the underground river, the end of the channel, to receive them. With a "plop" sound, like cargo falling into the water from a height, Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up. The water level this time was similar to when he and Yue Yang first entered the Styx River, but the banks were lined with warriors and heroines preparing to depart for Shambhala. As soon as Zhang Li saw Zhuo Mu Qiangba, he immediately pointed to a pile of plastic bags on the bank and said, "Young Master Qiangba, this pile of things is yours."

### 第一节 第一日

All the equipment was packed into waterproof plastic bags and sent into the underground river. The team members then crossed the narrow rapid channel by climbing along the underwater ropes. Zhang Li and Master Yala were stationed at the source of the underground river, the end of the channel, to receive them.

With a "plop" sound, like cargo falling into the water from a height, Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up. The water level this time was similar to when he and Yue Yang first entered the Styx River, but the banks were lined with warriors and heroines preparing to depart for Shambhala. As soon as Zhang Li saw Zhuo Mu Qiangba, he immediately pointed to a pile of plastic bags on the bank and said, "Young Master Qiangba, this pile of things is yours."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba came ashore and looked at the flashing lights. Everyone was busy sorting and restoring the numbered plastic bags. He called out loudly, "Listen up, everyone," pointing to the rope at the water outlet, "After the last two people come in, this rope will be dismantled. We can only move forward, with no retreat. Now that you have seen the environment here, this is your last chance to make a decision. Whatever choice you make, I, Zhuo Mu Qiangba, sincerely thank you. Thank you, everyone!"

The result was self-evident. Everyone looked expectantly towards the other end of the dark, deep cave, shouldering their huge backpacks with high spirits, fully equipped and ready to depart. When Yue Yang and Captain Hu Yang entered the cave, the soaked ropes were cut into sections and flowed downstream. Zhuo Mu Qiangba's heart sank. He knew that from this moment on, they had severed all contact with the outside world. The next moment, they would be heading to a place where light could not be seen, accompanied only by infinite darkness. As Zhuo Mu Qiangba gave the command: "Depart," the two groups, along the banks of the Styx River, facing the boundless darkness, took their first step in challenging the god of death.

The darkness seemed endless. The cave's echoes amplified the sound of countless footsteps, breaths, and dripping water manifold. The only sound absent was the flow of the pitch-black Styx River. This time entering the cave, the water level had dropped significantly compared to when Zhuo Mu Qiangba and Yue Yang first descended. The riverbanks had widened noticeably, and the jagged rocks hidden beneath the banks revealed their ferocious appearances. Under the illumination of countless headlights, the bizarre wonders of the underground river were fully displayed. Everyone gasped inwardly at the sight of things they had never seen before, but not a single person made a sound, silently following the main group, fearing they might break the mysterious tranquility.

Zhang Li and the other three led the way. Zhuo Mu Qiangba remained silent. Yue Yang also felt an indescribable unease. Did the progressively lower water level signify that its lowest turning point was approaching? When that time came, how would the water level rise? Would it suddenly fill the river channel?

After walking for about two hours, they finally reached the large boat that Zhang Li and his team had identified and tested. Although everyone was mentally prepared, seeing such a large boat suddenly in the dead, dark underground space still elicited gasps of surprise. The shouts were carried far by the cave, eventually sounding like ghostly wails.

At this moment, the serpentine boat was tethered to a rock pillar overhead by a thick rope, floating quietly in the water. The higher end stood tall, its peculiar shape, immense volume, and strange surface skin all causing amazement. Zhang Li pointed to the cowhide boat and announced, "Everyone, welcome aboard Ark One, and begin our dark rafting journey!" He pressed a switch, and the three searchlights pre-installed on the serpentine boat lit up simultaneously, illuminating the dark underground river. Zhang Li had preserved the serpentine boat's agility, equipping it with modern electronic equipment only in certain areas. At this moment, the serpentine boat truly embodied both ancient wisdom and modern technology.

Yan Yong threw his heavy backpack onto the boat without a word and then jumped in himself. The boat didn't even wobble, its buoyancy astonishing.

After everyone had boarded the cowhide boat, Zhang Li untied the rope and said, "You see, the design of this boat is very special. It can be said to be designed specifically for navigating this cave. Its hull is narrow and long, almost exceeding the maximum width of the cave. The keel adopts a peculiar spinal structure, which prevents the boat from angling sideways or reversing in the river channel. This spinal keel allows the hull to twist flexibly like a snake, easily maneuvering even through 90-degree right-angle turns that ordinary small boats cannot handle. In a sense, it's like a fish that can swim freely in the cave, and the fish's fins and tail are the oars we hold. Come on, let's get it moving!"

The crew members sat on both sides of the boat, with their backpacks placed on the empty seats on the other side. They wore life jackets and held plastic steel oars. There was a powerful searchlight at the bow and two at the stern, ensuring that every oarsman could see clearly beside and in front of them in the darkness. The lighting crew consisted of Yue Yang and Master Tashi. Zhang Li and Zhuo Mu Qiangba, who had visited the Styx River for the first time, sat behind Yue Yang. This allowed them to see the direction clearly and also to remind everyone. At Zhuo Mu Qiangba's quiet command, the keel boat shot out like an arrow from a bow...

Professor Fang Xin had just sat down when he received a phone call. The aged voice on the other end urgently asked, "Old Fang, where did you get the things you showed us?"

Professor Fang Xin replied, "Oh, is that Old Peng? You mean the scales? How is it? Did you find anything out? Could it really be something from an animal?"

Old Peng sounded very excited on the other end, "Incredible! Although we've analyzed and verified it repeatedly, it's clearly from some kind of animal. Although the structure of the skin is different from most animal skins today, it definitely belongs to animal leather, with a stratum corneum and basal layer."

Professor Fang Xin asked, "What kind of creature? Any clues?"

Old Peng replied, "No. It's just that this epidermal structure is different from most animal epidermis that I know. Studying it solely through cell structure yields very little information. In short... it just feels very strange. This material has piqued my curiosity. If only I had a small piece. I wonder if it's still possible to contact the person who provided it?"

Professor Fang Xin replied with a wry smile, "Really?... I don't know either. Where have they gone..."

At the very beginning, the boat moved very quickly, which greatly pleased Zhuo Mu Qiangba. If they calculated based on this speed, their estimated three-day plan to navigate the Styx River would definitely be completed ahead of schedule. However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba also had an ominous premonition. In the darkness, there were always unknown dangers waiting for them. All the crew members were working hard. Sailing in complete darkness didn't instill much fear in them; instead, it felt somewhat stimulating, being their first time rowing such a boat in this environment. Zhang Jian, Li Hong, and others were the most excited. Yan Yong, Chu Yan, and other veteran explorers appeared more composed.

As expected, the feeling of excitement didn't last long. To give everyone an early clear understanding of this underground current, Yue Yang, after obtaining Zhuo Mu Qiangba's consent, took everyone through the straight river channel they had navigated the first time. The rapids and steep slopes immediately tightened everyone's nerves. However, this was where the serpentine boat's advantage became apparent. The softened hull and the flexibly maneuverable spinal keel allowed the serpentine boat to adhere firmly to the water's surface. Each pair of ribs connected to the spinal vertebrae divided the serpentine boat into segments. The people sitting in the boat felt like they were on a roller coaster, sometimes plummeting downwards, sometimes swerving left and right to avoid rocks, and sometimes colliding with the cave walls or rock pillars. The resilient hull bounced off like a ball and then collided with the other side, requiring the crew's unified cooperation to barely control the direction.

After passing through the waterfall section for over ten minutes, those who were exhilarated earlier could no longer cheer. Li Hong and Zhao Zhuang Sheng gripped the sides of the boat, their hands turning pale. They had almost been thrown overboard twice. Everyone else had been splashed in the face with cold water. Chu Yan, who had participated in the Yaang rafting, actually smiled slightly, finding this level of rapids acceptable compared to Yaang rafting.

However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba showed no joy on his face. This was merely the beginning. In the darkness, they didn't know how many more such river sections lay ahead, and they would have to repeat this process for at least three days... Three days!

After turning past the conical platform, Zhuo Mu Qiangba consulted the map and discussed with Yue Yang, choosing a route that was not straight. This route seemed somewhat circuitous, but it was marked with the most platform graphics along the way. For some reason, both of them vaguely felt that this way was safer.

From the beginning, the crew members were divided into three groups, six people per group. When rowing, the three groups took turns, each responsible for a ten-minute river section. This ensured adequate rest time, and the resting members could talk to each other to alleviate their fear of the darkness. However, when encountering turbulent rapids and dangerous shoals, the entire crew had to work together. As the underground river's water level continuously dropped, the turbulent rapids and dangerous shoals became more numerous, and the situation was not optimistic. Later, they spent a full two hours navigating through turbulent rapids and dangerous shoals. After completing the longest section of the river, Yue Yang's face turned pale, and he murmured, "I didn't expect it to be like this." Zhuo Mu Qiangba remained silent, knowing that this was still just the beginning...

Since the river channel ahead would be shallower and the water would always flow downwards, with no riverbanks, stopping to rest would be impossible. Yue Yang finally discovered that only the platforms marked on the map were places where they could tie up the boat. Some protruded, or had vertical rock pillars. Other places were mostly flat walls, or were located at the edge of the most dangerous rapids. Even if they saw pillars in those places, they would flash by, making it impossible to stop the boat.

Yue Yang finally found a designated docking point marked on the map and stopped the boat. Everyone ate and rested, replenishing their strength. Zhuo Mu Qiangba consulted with Chu Yan, Lü Jingnan, Captain Hu Yang, Yue Yang, and others. They reallocated personnel. In calm river sections, it would be the same as before, divided into three groups for rowing. However, when encountering turbulent rapids and dangerous shoals, the number of people controlling the boat would increase to nine, ensuring that the other half had time to rest. Otherwise, if they encountered multiple rapid sections consecutively, all crew members' strength would be unsustainable.

During the rest period, Meng Haoran hadn't eaten anything, saying his stomach was churning badly and he couldn't eat. Chu Yan remarked, "I told you long ago, it's better to climb mountains than go down rivers. Rafting is completely different from mountain climbing. Now you know the difficulty, right? Even after special training, you're still like this."

Meng Haoran replied, "It's a bit different being in the water compared to being in a car. The floor beneath my feet feels soft, and the boat is constantly dropping. I still feel my internal organs falling. During training, it was up and down." After resting for a while, he also started eating.

Li Hong, with his mouth full of what was either chocolate or compressed biscuits, asked Chu Yan, "Brother Chu, you've participated in Yaang rafting. Compared to the Brahmaputra River, which is more difficult to raft?"

Chu Yan replied, "For rafting on the great rivers, we use small rubber boats and assault boats, which can hold at most seven or eight people. If the slope gradient is too large, we can enter sealed cabins. Compared to this underground river and the Brahmaputra River, it can be said that each has its own dangers. If we don't consider the surrounding environment, the dangerous sections of the Brahmaputra River are definitely more dangerous than this underground river. It has huge rocks falling from both banks that block the river channel in the middle, and there are waterfalls of several meters, or even tens or hundreds of meters. Although we claim to have rafted the entire Brahmaputra River, in reality, we haven't rafted the entire length. Many sections are simply too dangerous to raft; we carried tools and walked along the banks. However, the surrounding environment of this underground river is more severe than the Brahmaputra River. Firstly, there is no light. Without these high-power searchlights, we would be unable to move an inch. Secondly, there are no places to stop. We have to stay on the boat for all three days, seventy-two hours in complete darkness, seventy-two hours in the same place. These two points alone are probably enough to make many rafters give up. However, based on my observations so far, the slope gradient is not too large. The largest waterfall is only about one meter high, which is nothing for this ten-meter-plus large boat. However, this boat can only be used for rafting in this cave; if it reached the outer banks and got stuck on rocks, it would be like a dead snake."

Li Hong questioned, "According to Brother Chu, isn't rafting in this underground river easier than Yaang rafting?"

Before Chu Yan could answer, Basang let out a cold sneer. Yan Yong calmly replied, "We can't say that. Brother Chu completed the entire Yaang rafting before comparing it with this underground river, while we've only been rafting for half a day. We don't know what the river sections ahead will be like."

After resting, the third group began rowing. Shortly after rounding the first bend, a subtle jolt alerted Zhuo Mu Qiangba.

"Wait a moment," Yue Yang said first.

"Stop!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba issued the command. All the crew members neatly put away their oars, like canoe polo players at a sports event.

"Listen, what's that sound?" Yue Yang warned.

Everyone didn't need to concentrate; as soon as they stopped rowing, they heard it. A "buzzing" sound echoed in their ears. The cave passage amplified all internal sounds exponentially.

Li Dingming immediately associated it with his profession, "Is it insects?"

It did sound like the buzzing of mosquitoes. Chu Yan and others immediately said, "Hey, what's the big deal about insects? Is it worth stopping for?" They picked up their oars, ready to continue.

However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba and others, who had emerged from the Amazon jungle and the Hanging Temple, knew clearly that some insects were more terrifying than imagined. Moreover, there were no insects when they first came to this underground river.

"It's not insects, look at the water surface!" Yue Yang made another discovery.

Under the searchlight, everyone noticed the river surface. The formerly smooth, glass-like pitch-black water was now rippled like a fishing net... It was water ripples. The people on the boat had some outdoor experience and knew that such fine ripples on the water surface only occurred due to high-frequency vibrations. However, there was nothing on the river surface or the banks at this moment, and their boat was drifting downstream. What could be causing the ripples? It could only be—the entire cave was vibrating!

All the crew members steered the boat towards the right bank. The crew members on the right extended their hands and immediately retracted them. Indeed, the electric shock-like vibration indicated that the entire tunnel wall was vibrating at high frequency. The mosquito-like buzzing sound originated from these walls! Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What's going on here? Yue Yang?"

Yue Yang frowned, clearly puzzled by this as well. What could cause the entire tunnel's rock walls to vibrate? Suddenly, he seemed to understand something and asked, "What time is it now?"

Zhang Li checked his atomic watch and replied, "It's 11:21 PM."

Yue Yang continued, "Young Master Qiangba, what about the map? Let's check the time marked for the first platform." He then added, "Tell everyone to keep rowing forward. I hope my prediction is wrong."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked back and said, "Everyone, don't stop, keep moving forward. Zhang Li, please coordinate."

The computer brought up the map. At the location they had marked, after Zhuo Mu Qiangba's careful identification, he finally said, "According to the map, it should be around 11:30 PM to 12:00 AM at night. What did you think of, Yue Yang?"

Yue Yang replied, "Although I don't know what happened yet, I think we must reach the next platform before 11:30 AM. This is very important."

Zhang Li started a chant, and the oars fell uniformly and powerfully. Yue Yang and Zhuo Mu Qiangba also joined in rowing. Although they didn't know why, they instinctively felt they had to reach the designated location according to the time marked on the map.

As they continued forward, the buzzing sound grew louder until they reached another platform. Yue Yang looked at the hull and then at the rock pillar as thick as several people embracing it, and suddenly exclaimed, "Young Master Qiangba, aren't we always guessing what that pillar is for? If I'm not mistaken, it's for tying up boats!"

"Ah? For tying up boats? Why?" Zhang Li asked.

Just as the buzzing sound grew louder, Yue Yang said, "There's no time to explain. Let's tie up the boat first, Young Master Qiangba!"

Although the new team members could use grappling hooks to varying degrees, they were not as proficient as the veterans in extending their grappling hooks as an extension of their bodies. Yue Yang and Zhang Li threw their grappling hooks, which barely managed to drill into the rock walls. The two climbed the walls like agile apes. Zhuo Mu Qiangba threaded the main rope through a string of quickdraws and, with a slight swing, threw the rope upwards. The other end was tied to the thick, protruding end of the keel. Zhang Li and Yue Yang quickly wrapped the main rope around the thick pillar and tied it securely. Just as they finished, the buzzing sound had already turned into a roar. Not only was the river surface violently vibrating, but the people on the boat could clearly feel the entire tunnel cave shaking, as if the mountains were collapsing and the earth splitting. At that moment, a sense of unease and trepidation swept through every crew member.

"Look! What is that!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng, who was sitting at the bow of the boat, behind Zhang Li, suddenly shouted.

The searchlight was still shining forward, but the cave depths, which should have been pitch black, suddenly revealed something. Reflecting the searchlight's beam, it was roaring towards them with an earth-shattering sound. Its speed was incredibly fast, causing the entire cave to tremble. As it entered the searchlight's range, everyone saw a silvery white wall charging towards them, resembling countless silver insects rolling and tumbling as they impacted. It was water! A massive surge of water! Only when water is released from a dam can such fierce water be seen! From a kilometer away in the darkness, it began to reveal itself. This silver dragon charged towards them with bared teeth and claws, intending to tear apart any obstacles in its path. The sound of the surging tide, echoed repeatedly by the cave, finally resonated, causing the entire cave to vibrate.

"Heavens..." Someone exclaimed, followed by silence. Everyone felt difficulty breathing.

Only Zhuo Mu Qiangba remained calm and commanded, "Everyone, secure your backpacks, hold onto the gunwales, and lower your heads. Prepare to hold your breath. Here it comes!"

With a "boom," an accidental wave washed over the serpentine boat's bow, as if a tiny insect had flown into the mouth of the silver dragon. It didn't attract the dragon's attention at all. With its unconquerable arrogance, it continued to charge forward rapidly.

A moment later, Zhang Li and Yue Yang nervously stared at the taut main rope. At the end submerged in water, with a "splash," the serpentine boat surfaced again. However, its position at this moment was abruptly six or seven meters higher than before. The raised bow of the boat acted as a baffle. Under such a tidal wave, the hull hardly took on any water, instead riding the crest of the wave at a 45-degree angle, lifting the entire boat. Only the crew members leaning against the gunwales had water splashed in their faces.

After the wave passed, the people in the boat raised their heads, shaking the water from their faces and gasping for air. When someone wiped the cold water from their faces, they were shocked to see Yue Yang and Zhang Li, who were previously high above, now only a few meters higher. They hadn't expected such dangerous situations to occur just a few hours after starting. Li Hong and Zhao Zhuang Sheng, who had been excited earlier, turned pale, unsure what thoughts were running through their minds.

Everyone worked together, slowly guiding the boat towards the rock face where Yue Yang and Zhang Li were standing. The aftereffects of the monstrous wave had not yet subsided, and they didn't know if another surge would occur. While calming their nerves, they waited for the underground river's backflow to subside.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba wiped the water dripping from his forehead and asked Yue Yang, "How did you know to tie the boat up there?"

Yue Yang shrugged, jumped into the boat, and replied, "There are only a few things about this underground river that we haven't fully understood yet. First, why does the Brahmaputra River rise at night, and why is it backflowing from the underground river? Second, the channels and platforms marked on the map have been confirmed, but what are the time markers left beside the platforms for? If they don't indicate the time it takes to traverse this path, what do they refer to? Third, there are traces of rope marks left on the platforms at two locations. These marks would take a long time to form; tying the boat once or twice wouldn't leave marks on such solid rocks. Fourth, how did the madman of the Gobar tribe control such a large boat against the current? And how did he emerge from that cave? Yue Yang held the searchlight, turned his head to look at the Styx River, which was still experiencing residual waves, and then looked back, "Actually, I found the answer among these questions."

Zhang Li squatted by the rock wall and asked, "How do they connect?"

Yue Yang replied, "Do you remember what I said before? The rope marks left on these rock pillars weren't made overnight; it took many ties to leave them. This cliff is too narrow for even standing, so the ancients must have tied the boats here multiple times for reasons other than resting on the cliff. And the time ranges marked on the map have been confirmed; it's not the time it takes us to travel from one point to another. I suddenly connected the time ranges marked on the map with the time of the Brahmaputra River's nocturnal rise. The sudden surge in water volume indicates that the underground river was almost filled instantly. If that's the case, it seems to explain the ancients' motive for tying up the boats. Isn't that right, Young Master Qiangba?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "Let's rest for a while, and then we'll continue."

The darkness was boundless. The searchlight swayed with the boat's movement, casting flickering shadows like monsters on the distant rock walls. The group, exhausted, lay slanted on the boat. They hadn't expected the first twenty-four hours to almost completely deplete their energy. The degree and duration of their ups and downs in the turbulent currents far exceeded the endurance of ordinary people. With this deep exhaustion, they had no sleepiness, as the three bright searchlights were placed at the bow of the boat. This light absolutely could not be extinguished.

Lü Jingnan, Master Yala, Chu Yan, and five others seized the opportunity to rest. Yue Yang, too excited every time they encountered rapids, had lost his voice and could only remain silent. Zhang Li and Li Hong, the younger ones, were full of energy and were still chatting and boasting. Zhuo Mu Qiangba observed everyone's condition. Zhang Xiang was praying again, with the first page of the Bible open before his knees, which read:

"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. The Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light 'day,' and the darkness he called 'night.' And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day."

### 第二节 第二日

Zhuo Mu Qiangba first went to Meng Haoran's side. Tang Min was examining him, while Master Tashi waited patiently nearby. The poet-photographer, who feared no mountains, looked somewhat pale. He said tiredly, "I'm fine, just a bit uncomfortable in my stomach. I'll be better after resting for a while. Maybe I ate too much wild game yesterday, causing indigestion today."

Tang Min asked, "Does it hurt here? Do you feel like vomiting?" Master Tashi's fingers rested on Meng Haoran's wrist, taking his pulse.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba knew that experiencing symptoms of discomfort so early on was not a good sign. However, their current situation was not optimistic. He knew clearly that there was only one way forward in this underground river; returning was impossible. Master Tashi diagnosed, "Disharmony of the spleen and stomach, likely due to deficiency of qi and yin. For now, simply regulate the spleen and stomach with mild warming tonics, and it will be fine." Tang Min added, "It seems to be indigestion caused by catching a chill. The bumpy ride in the boat makes you want to vomit. Let's try giving him a dose of domperidone to see how it goes."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba felt slightly relieved and told Meng Haoran to take care of himself and continue onward. He then went to Sean. This foreigner with silver hair and blue eyes was the only non-Chinese member of their adventure team. Sean spoke limited Chinese but understood some of it. Sometimes, when Zhang Li told jokes, he would listen intently. When Zhuo Mu Qiangba approached, Sean was chatting happily in English with Li Dingming. "Hey, Sean, Dingming." Zhuo Mu Qiangba greeted them.

Sean remarked, "Qiang Sheng, you finally have some time to rest. This team is hard to lead."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "It's not hard to lead at all. Everyone has experience in outdoor adventures, and there are almost no conflicts, making it easy to coordinate everyone's relationships. I'm just a little worried about you, as this is your first time in Tibet. How are you adjusting?"

Sean counted on his fingers, "Adjusting? Yes. Look, Zhang Li, Yue Yang, Basang, you, Minmin, Mr. Li, Zhang Xiang, Master Yala, Instructor—almost more than half the people speak English. I have nothing to be unaccustomed to. And I can speak Chinese too." He then said in broken Chinese, "Hello!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba laughed. Li Dingming added, "Mr. Sean is actually quite knowledgeable about biology. We were just talking about the magical creatures in the Amazon jungle..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "Oh, I almost forgot. Dingming is also an animal behaviorist."

Li Dingming clarified, "Amphibians."

The three chatted for a while until Lü Jingnan called Zhuo Mu Qiangba over. Currently, Lü Jingnan, Captain Hu Yang, Zhuo Mu Qiangba, and Yan Yong were the four main decision-makers of the team. Many matters were decided through discussions among these four. The rest of the team members privately referred to these four as the "Big Four."

The four discussed whether to adjust the seating arrangements and made plans for the next day's itinerary and rest periods. Afterward, Zhuo Mu Qiangba returned to the bow and chatted with Tang Min for a while. Tang Min was tired and leaned her head on Zhuo Mu Qiangba's lap, falling asleep. Watching the sleeping Minmin, Zhuo Mu Qiangba glanced at Zhang Li and the others chatting at the bow, thinking, "Finally, we've survived the first twenty-four hours. The real hardship has just begun. People still have a relatively clear biological clock within the first twenty-four hours. However, after entering the second twenty-four hours, the biological clock begins to become disordered. When it's time to sleep, you don't feel tired; when it's time to eat, you don't feel hungry. Everything becomes chaotic. At that point, I don't know how many people's bodies can endure it. Finally, Zhuo Mu Qiangba also quietly fell asleep."

In his dazed state, he seemed to hear his father's familiar voice again: "Child, I know you dislike religion and don't believe in gods or Buddhas, but some things cannot be denied. In fact, everyone has their own faith in their hearts. Whether you have a religious background or are an atheist, that faith is pursuit, a force that drives people to live. Survival is the instinct of humans and all creatures in their material desires. From the moment life is born, it is destined to struggle and strive continuously to survive. Faith, however, is the instinct of humans in their spiritual desires. Sometimes, it even surpasses the physical desires of humans, driving them to accomplish the impossible. However, humans are fragile, not only physically but also spiritually. Ancient humans, due to their physical weakness and lack of knowledge, were naturally afraid of the unknown. They feared unfamiliar things, feared unfamiliar powers. Ancient people were like newborn infants, full of curiosity and fear towards everything. People will always encounter problems they cannot solve, fears they cannot overcome. At this time, people's spirits need a spiritual anchor. They hope for something that can help them in their difficulties, give them hope in their despair, bring light from the darkness, and expel the fear and evil from the depths of their hearts. Thus, gods came to be..."

"Young Master Qiangba, wake up..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba felt like he had only slept for a moment before hearing Yue Yang's call. He opened his eyes and heard Yue Yang say, "The second wave of rising water is probably coming soon."

"What! So soon!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was startled, his sleepiness completely gone. He turned over and stood up, asking, "Are you sure?"

Yue Yang handed him the open laptop, saying, "Young Master Qiangba, look. This is another abstract symbol on the map that we haven't fully understood. Why are the marked times so abstract that even Master Yala and the others couldn't identify them? After repeated observation, I found that these symbols are not a complete animal, but a combination of two animals. Look at this one, a bull's head and a chicken's tail. And this one, a tiger's face and a monkey's body. That's why it's so difficult to understand. Then I thought of the poem from Gongbu Village, which says the warriors only rest twice a day. Why twice? If the animals representing time are not one, but two... Also, the times recorded by our observation points clearly show that the Brahmaputra River rises twice every day, just that one time is more than the other. If we restore the two parts of the animals, then it would be this time period."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What time is it?"

Yue Yang replied, "It's 5 AM."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba remarked, "I slept for so long."

Yue Yang suggested, "Young Master Qiangba, look, shouldn't we wake everyone up..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba responded, "Okay, wake everyone up. This matter cannot be overlooked."

Everyone was woken up groggily. Some complained that they had just fallen asleep, while others seemed not to have slept at all. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at them with concern. "Hey, everyone, pull yourselves together!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba encouraged them, "Listen, the second wave of water is coming soon. If you don't want to fall behind so quickly, get energized! Hold onto the boat tightly!"

"What!"

"It's coming again!"

"Oh my gosh!" The new team members cried out in unison. However, an ominous sound quickly silenced them, "Buzzing..." "Mmm... mmm..." Ripples appeared on the water surface again. Yue Yang's prediction was correct. This was a warning signal that made everyone's hearts clench.

Roaring forward and then whistling away, the silver dragon was like the sanitation crew of this underground kingdom, cleaning the cave once in a while. Its irresistible power made people tremble. This time, the surge was even greater and more rapid. The entire keel boat was tossed up from the water like a speed boat several times. The spray from the bow splashed everyone on the boat, soaking them. Everyone gripped the gunwales, their knuckles turning white. They all knew that if they let go, they would fall behind Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Behind them lay endless darkness. No one knew where the turbulent currents would carry them, nor how long they could endure within these currents. Yue Yang, holding onto the bow of the boat, watched vigilantly. The main rope, stretched taut, continuously tightened under the immense force of the water, twisting tightly into the keel, making a "creaking" sound. Yue Yang's heart tightened like the keel. He knew that if the main rope broke under such great force, it would be fortunate if the entire boat was only pushed back to the starting position. If the boat got stuck somewhere or capsized and broke, it would undoubtedly be a complete annihilation. He had made up his mind: they had to endure this wave of surging water, and next time they tied up, they should use at least two main ropes.

With a "clatter," Yue Yang's vision suddenly turned black. Light shone from behind him. It turned out that the immense impact had tossed the keel boat high up, and the searchlight at the bow collided with a hanging stalactite overhead, immediately extinguishing. Then came an "ouch," and someone cried out.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's voice commanded, "Careful! Watch out for the stalactites overhead! Hold onto the gunwales, lie down, quickly lie down!"

A dark shadow swept past overhead. Zhao Zhuang Sheng saw it clearly, reached out, and at that very moment, the surging water suddenly subsided, and then rose sharply again. The stern of the serpentine boat suddenly tilted upwards. Li Dingming and Zhao Zhuang Sheng simultaneously slipped their fingers and were thrown into the air. Basang and Master Yala, sitting behind them, reached out and firmly grabbed their ankles. Master Yala said to Zhao Zhuang Sheng, "Got you!"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng instead shouted, "Let go of me!" Master Yala sat solemnly and recited scriptures, regardless of Zhao Zhuang Sheng's struggles, unable to break free. Zhao Zhuang Sheng screamed, "Li Hong! Li Hong fell!" Yue Yang, at the bow, heard this and his heart tightened!

Li Dingming was thrown heavily back onto the boat by Basang. Then the boat swayed again. Basang said in a hoarse voice, "Grab your backpacks!"

At this moment, the serpentine boat was like a car speeding down a rocky slope, shaking up and down with the water flow. The entire process lasted for several minutes, and the turbulent waves gradually subsided. Among these people, only the veteran team members who had been to the Americas could truly appreciate the power of the turbulent waves and their irresistible force. Recalling it, it was a ceaseless bumping, as if all their bones had been shaken loose, and even their consciousness and thoughts became blurred due to the violent shaking. Only a clear point of clarity remained in their minds, controlling their fingers to hold on tightly, knowing that nothing else mattered. The current situation was the same. The hands gripping the gunwales seemed to gather all their strength, while the rest of their bodies had lost all sensation. Even though the waves had calmed, they would need to rest for a long time to regain strength in their muscles. Meng Haoran, not understanding the reason, stumbled as soon as he stood up. He knelt on the boat, gripping his backpack with both hands, only to find his arms trembling slightly. Turning to look, he saw that not only himself but also Li Dingming was trembling even more severely.

After a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, Master Tashi was the first to stand up, take a few steady steps forward, and approach Zhang Xiang, asking, "Are you okay?" He clearly saw that a huge stone pillar had scraped heavily against Zhang Xiang's back. In the chaos, that "ouch" was Zhang Xiang's cry.

Zhang Xiang's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his face was pale. He smiled and said, "I'm fine, just bumped into it. *Hiss*!" Master Tashi gently lifted Zhang Xiang's vest and saw that Zhang Xiang's back was scraped off a large piece of flesh, bleeding profusely. Tang Min, seeing this from behind, exclaimed, "Oh my!"

Master Tashi said to Tang Min, "I think we need something to stop the bleeding."

Tang Min released her grip on the gunwale, her hands trembling. She tried to open the backpack zipper several times but couldn't. Master Tashi came to help. Tang Min instructed, "The gauze is in the second pocket, followed by bandages. The disinfectant is in the third compartment on the left." Lü Jingnan also came to help.

Yue Yang clenched his fists. His limbs could move. He leaned sideways and grabbed Zhang Li, saying, "Come and take a look at this light; it seems to be damaged." Chu Yan, standing nearby, commented, "It looks like it's broken. I saw that pillar directly hit the lamp cover."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and asked Yan Yong and Captain Hu Yang, two exploration captains who hadn't experienced the tidal surge, "Are you two alright?" Both shook their heads and simultaneously looked towards the injured Zhang Xiang.

Yan Yong stated, "Alright, we've survived again." As he spoke, he tried to stand up, but his knees went weak, and he stumbled forward, grabbing Zhang Li's backpack with his hands, managing not to fall to the ground. He then realized the right side was empty and asked, "Where's Li Hong?"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng roared. As Master Yala loosened his grip, he lunged into the Styx River. Basang shouted, "Nonsense! Don't go looking for death!"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was also startled. Li Hong was right behind him. He had let go without making a sound. At that time, everyone had their heads bowed, and no one noticed Li Hong sweeping past them. Looking at the suddenly rising ten-meter-high tidal wave, if he had been washed away during the surge, there would be no finding him.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba and the others went to the stern of the boat and shone the searchlight onto the water surface, looking for Zhao Zhuang Sheng's figure. After a moment, Zhao Zhuang Sheng emerged from the dark river, angrily striking the water surface with his hands, splashing large amounts of water, and cursing, "Li Hong fell, why didn't you grab him! You're all so capable! Hmph! *Cough cough*... *Gurgle gurgle*..." He then sank again...

Yue Yang called from the stern, "Skinny, come up quickly! There are more small waves behind you; you'll be swept away!" But Zhao Zhuang Sheng didn't answer. He waved his hands in the air, seemingly not quite right.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba, without even taking off his clothes, jumped into the water and pulled Zhao Zhuang Sheng back, shouting loudly, "Li Hong is gone, and we are all very sad. But by doing this, do you want us to lose another teammate?"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng was pulled back onto the boat. Zhuo Mu Qiangba also returned to the boat. The water temperature was icy cold, and he couldn't help but shiver. Zhao Zhuang Sheng sat in the boat wrapped in a blanket, murmuring aimlessly, "He told me yesterday that after we get back, we'll climb Ka­wa Karpo Peak together..." He also knew that Li Hong had flown away from the boat at least three to four meters high, and no one could have pulled him back. He himself had only leaned out slightly and was almost swept away with Li Hong.

Yue Yang's lips trembled slightly, and his face turned deathly pale as he approached Zhao Zhuang Sheng. The two looked at each other with melancholy, seeing the sorrow in each other's eyes. Yue Yang hadn't expected Li Hong to leave so quickly, so suddenly. After the surge, the pitch-black river surface was calm, and nothing could be seen.

"Li Hong—" Yue Yang suddenly roared into the darkness.

"Li Hong... Li Hong... Li Hong..." The cave echoed with successive calls, clearly hearing Yue Yang's fading shouts.

"Must survive—"

"Must survive... Must survive... Must survive..." Zhao Zhuang Sheng also roared along. Their voices intertwined like dragons entwined in the turbulent currents, drifting far away with the rapids, leaving behind ripples, and then dissipating into nothingness. Everyone knew that the chances of survival in such currents were almost zero. But perhaps Li Hong had been washed ashore on some platform, perhaps he had grabbed an overhanging rock pillar, or maybe... maybe he could wade through the darkness and return to Gongbu Village. Yue Yang and Zhao Zhuang Sheng both thought this way, comforting themselves, suppressing the sorrow in their hearts and the tears in their eyes, silently gazing into the darkness.

Lü Jingnan's expression was blank as she said to Yue Yang, "Don't forget, you are a soldier. Return to your post. If you don't want more people to disappear."

Sean looked back at Wang You. These two former fellow travelers who had gone to the Americas spoke little during training. They maintained a distance from each other, instead mingling with the new team members. "How is it? More exciting than when we were in the Americas?" Sean asked with a slight smile. Wang You's hands were still stiffly gripping the gunwale. He replied faintly, "This is nothing."

At the stern of the boat, Basang also stood up, looking at the water flow on the side of the boat. He patted Li Dingming, who was still recovering from shock, on the chest, and then turned to look at Master Yala. The master sat like a statue. From the moment the surging water hit, Master Yala did not hold onto the gunwale, but his body seemed glued to the hull, motionless. At this moment, he maintained that posture, as if still in meditation. Basang couldn't help but stroke his beard. He increasingly couldn't figure out this seemingly frail old lama, nor Master Tashi, nor Lü Jingnan, nor Young Master Qiangba, nor the unfathomable Sean. There were truly too many skilled individuals on this boat.

Zhang Xiang's back had been disinfected with hydrogen peroxide and bandaged. The pain was less obvious. The others recovered gradually, chatting in twos and threes. Only Li Dingming tightly gripped his backpack, his face pale, his lips bluish, and his mouth twitching occasionally. Everyone knew he was scared. Yes, having come so close to death once was enough for an ordinary person, let alone experiencing continuous situations like this for the next two days. No one blamed him; everyone came to comfort him.

Finally, Li Dingming's mood stabilized slightly. Captain Hu Yang voluntarily offered to switch places with Li Dingming, so Li Dingming sat at the stern, where Captain Hu Yang had been.

The searchlight at the bow was broken. Zhang Li replaced it with a new one, having been prepared for such situations. They had several spare lights. The only thing they hadn't prepared for was the intensity of the surging water. Zhang Li thought for a moment and suggested utilizing the main rope to tie it to the boat's ribs, with each team member secured to the boat with quickdraws, so they wouldn't be thrown off during the bumps. No sooner said than done, Zhang Li replaced the light head and began modifying the serpentine boat. Soon, the boat was brightly lit and set sail again.

### 第三节 黑漩涡激流

Yue Yang stared intently at the computer, carefully identifying the path they had taken and measuring the distance traveled with the instruments. After they had drifted 211 kilometers downstream, Yue Yang croaked hoarsely to Zhuo Mu Qiangba, "Young Master Qiangba, have everyone pay attention to controlling the speed. Slow down ahead. We're entering an area with many岔路 (forks). If you're not careful, we might get lost."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba called out loudly, "Third group, stern rowers, stop paddling! Yan Yong, Li Hong, Sean, and Master Tashi, all reduce your paddling frequency." Fearing Sean wouldn't understand, Zhuo Mu Qiangba also said it in English.

Yue Yang stared intently at the river channel ahead. The pitch-black river water showed thin strip-like ripples. Yue Yang exclaimed, "Young Master Qiangba, rapids! Another rapid section!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba announced, "Entering the rapid section, everyone get ready!"

Everyone took out their oars. Just as they were ready, Yue Yang shouted hoarsely, "Underwater waterfall!"

The entire boat tilted downwards from the bow, followed by a roller-coaster-like sensation. The serpentine boat hugged the water surface, sliding down the waterfall like a giant soft worm. Before the hull could stabilize, the bow suddenly dropped into the air, followed by another underwater waterfall. There were five consecutive waterfalls. Fortunately, Zhang Li's climbing-style anchoring prevented the crew from being thrown off the boat. However, this continuous free-fall motion, followed by hitting solid ground, was no different from jumping from a height of five meters five times in a row. All the crew members turned pale, and their stomachs churned with nausea. txt Novel Paradise Online Bookstore Update http://www.xiaoshuotxt.com/』『E-book Download http://txt.xiaoshuotxt.com/』http://www.huanhun.com/

This was not the end. After falling down the fifth set of waterfalls, Yue Yang announced, "Main channel of the underground river, Level 3 warning."

Chu Yan couldn't help but curse, "Damn it!" The serpentine boat crashed heavily into the river channel.

The main channel of this underground river was twenty meters wide, rushing from east to west. The turbulent waves were three to four meters high. Upon crashing into the main channel, it felt as if the serpentine boat had been flushed out from a small hole in the side wall. Once in the main underground river, the entire hull turned sideways. The searchlights continuously cast circles of light on the cave walls on both sides. Yue Yang, ignoring his sore throat, shouted loudly, "Direction! Hold the direction steady! Left-side crew, retract oars! Right side, row backward! I mean row backward! Don't row forward! Change direction, change direction!"

"There's a fork to the left 200 meters ahead. Everyone together..." Yue Yang stopped himself, "It's too late!"

"Listen to me! When I say left, the left-side crew paddles with all their might. The right side paddles in the opposite direction. This way, we can control the direction! If I say right, it's the opposite of left. If I say 'in,' everyone paddles forward. If I say 'back,' everyone paddles backward. Understand, everyone!"

"Attention, left!"

"We missed it! There are five more fork paths ahead to choose from. Right! Right! Right!"

"We must stabilize the hull first! Then, right!"

"Right!"

"Right!"

"No, the boat can't straighten its direction. We can't enter the designated cave at all. It seems we can only let the boat go straight ahead. There are forks ahead, but judging by the color markings, they are not easy paths."

The enormous serpentine boat spun in the vast underground river, sometimes hitting the left wall, sometimes the right wall, and then starting to rotate in the opposite direction. Each collision resulted in a violent rebound. The resilient hull seemed fine, but the crew members inside, especially the new ones, were finding it unbearable. The centrifugal force generated by the rotation was enough to make people dizzy. The severe tremors caused by each collision felt like they would shake their internal organs out of their chests. Sometimes, watching the boat speed towards the side wall, the groups who couldn't retract their oars in time had their wrists numb from the impact. Fortunately, the oars were made of plastic steel, so even with severe collisions, they would only bend and deform, not break. However, such rotation made it impossible for people in the boat to steady themselves, and they frequently bumped into their teammates, resulting in elbows or kicks to the face and body, or being "kissed" by the oars, leaving large bruises. Yue Yang was the unluckiest. He sat directly in front of Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Zhuo Mu Qiangba's bones were so hard! Although it was unintentional, Yue Yang let out a muffled cry every time they collided unexpectedly.

"Careful!" "You bumped into me!" "Ouch, my back!" "Everyone sit tight, sit tight!" "Your oar!" "My butt!"

The flashing searchlights only increased the sense of dizziness. After a short while, Wang You suddenly felt a warmth on his face, slippery and sticky, he didn't know what it was. He turned his head and saw that it was Meng Haoran, unable to tolerate the rotation and collisions, spitting out his food. Wang You's stomach was already churning, and being sprayed by Meng Haoran, he suddenly felt an indescribable nausea. Leaning against the gunwale, he opened his mouth and spat out whatever he had eaten. Zhao Zhuang Sheng, sitting behind Meng Haoran, also shouted, "You spit on me!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba yelled loudly, "Stop arguing! Hold onto the main rope, everyone retract your oars! This river channel is not short, and we'll be rotating for quite a while. Everyone hold on! If you feel nauseous, just vomit over the gunwale. Don't keep staring at where the searchlights are shining!"

Everyone felt like they were sitting on a spinning wheel, disoriented and unable to tell east from west.

Waves three to five meters high crashed head-on continuously. If it were any other boat, it would have capsized and overturned, perhaps being dragged to the bottom of the river by the undertows and whirlpools. Even for the serpentine boat, the situation was not optimistic. Due to the flexibility of the serpentine boat's hull, this characteristic became a danger in the turbulent troughs and crests of the waves. As the bow began to climb another large wave, the hull was still in the trough, causing the entire boat to fold into a "U" shape. The people at the bow and stern fell towards the middle. Just as they reached the crest of the wave, the serpentine boat collapsed like a broken spine, forming an inverted "U" shape, and the crew members in the middle were thrown outwards. During this process, the entire boat was also continuously rotating. At this moment, the serpentine boat resembled a butterfly nearing the end of its life. The bow and stern were the butterfly's wings. The butterfly struggled and flapped its wings from time to time, but helplessly spiraled and fell. If the crew members hadn't secured themselves to the hull with ropes, they would have fallen off the boat countless times.

At a wave crest, Zhuo Mu Qiangba was pressed against Yue Yang's backpack. Both were thrown to the left by the boat's inertia, like a pair of lead balls hanging from a swing. He shouted loudly, "How many forks have we missed?"

The next moment, Yue Yang was pressed against Zhuo Mu Qiangba's chest. Both were thrown to the right together. Yue Yang also shouted hoarsely, "I don't know! There's no light! I can't see anything!" Indeed, the searchlights either shone diagonally upwards towards the ceiling or straight into the water, making it impossible to see the condition of the walls. Yue Yang shouted loudly, "Zhang Li! Can you stop the searchlights from shaking with the boat!"

Zhang Li replied loudly, "Ah! What did you say?" Another monstrous wave crashed over them, drowning out all sound.

The bow and stern of the boat sprang upwards again, rotating clockwise. Zhuo Mu Qiangba and Yue Yang were simultaneously pressed towards Zhang Li. Chu Yan's upper body was thrown out of the boat, and he could only grab the safety rope tightly with both hands, shouting loudly, "Zhang Li, you kicked me in the face!" Zhang Li, squeezed like compressed biscuits by Yue Yang and Zhuo Mu Qiangba, managed a wry smile and replied, "Sorry."

Before he finished speaking, the serpentine boat collided with the wall on the left or right, suddenly jolted, and then began to rotate in the opposite direction. The force of this collision was so great that the crew members on the right side were thrown out of the boat, relying entirely on safety ropes to hang onto the hull. Even those still inside the boat were dragged by the rapidly rotating serpentine boat, their feet leaving the ground. Under the searchlight, they looked like rows of dried meat hanging in a strong wind, swaying back and forth.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba shouted loudly to the people behind him, "Those behind, did you see? How many cave branches did we miss?"

No one answered. What Yue Yang couldn't observe, others couldn't either, especially given the current terrible situation. After enduring the offensively sour food vomited by someone, they were then punched and kicked from behind. Everyone was involuntarily tossed about. The serpentine boat was like a furious bull, trying to throw off the cowboys riding on its back, one by one. Among these people, only a few could suppress the churning in their stomachs and refrain from vomiting during such rotation and tossing.

In the rapid rotation, Zhuo Mu Qiangba's eyes flashed. He saw several dark cave openings illuminated by the searchlight. It seemed the main channel of the underground river had reached its end, and they were about to enter branching river channels. He shouted loudly, "Yue Yang, it's a fork ahead. Pay attention, and see which cave we're entering!" Just as he finished speaking, a large backpack flew towards Zhuo Mu Qiangba with a "whoosh," like a small mountain. At this moment, Zhuo Mu Qiangba was rotating with the boat towards the right, his feet moving like a drunken boxer. In the midst of the chaos, he waved his hand to support it. The small mountain flew towards Yue Yang's back and then floated out of the boat, disappearing into the dark river. Following that, someone else's backpack "whooshed" and flew up, almost knocking Yan Yong away!

Zhang Li, suspended in the air, twisted his head to avoid Yan Yong's foot and shouted, "Whose bag dropped! Everyone hold onto your backpacks! Don't let the bags fly out of the boat!" It turned out that Zhang Li's fixed points were calculated based on the intensity of the rapids during their first voyage. He hadn't expected such terrifying underground currents, and the backpack straps couldn't withstand such immense centrifugal force, breaking and flying away.

The entire process happened in an instant. The impact left Yue Yang seeing stars. He shouted loudly, "I can't see, Young Master Qiangba, I can't see!" After his vision recovered, he only saw the serpentine boat rotating in a smaller river channel. Under the light, the side walls were very close to the hull. Yue Yang murmured, "Are we... have we entered a branch channel?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Mmm. Be careful!" The serpentine boat violently hit the side wall again, then swayed left and right. Those people suspended in the air suddenly felt the pulling force disappear, and they all fell back into the boat, rolling back and forth like a sieve. Immediately after, the serpentine boat, like a nimble snake, turned several S-shaped bends, seemingly entering another cave branch. However, everyone was lying at the bottom of the boat at this moment and didn't have the strength to get up.

The subsequent tremors and undulations were much smaller, but the waves of three to four meters high continued to hit them head-on. The boat crew was not having an easy time. This seven-hour rough ride, which felt like riding a wild bull, continuously jumping up and down, seven hours of spinning like a fan, with no mooring, no calm. When the boat entered a shallow water area and gradually stabilized, everyone was utterly exhausted. Several team members were even foaming at the mouth and rolling their eyes.

"Where are we now?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked up at the pitch-black ceiling, as if asking, but also murmuring to himself. Yue Yang replied, "I don't know, Young Master Qiangba. We should get up and look... look..." He spoke with difficulty, and moving was even harder. Yue Yang struggled at the bottom of the boat for a while, and Zhuo Mu Qiangba could hear the "thump, thump, thump" of his heels and spine hitting the hull. Yet, he couldn't get up no matter how hard he tried.

Zhang Li stated, "We're in hell. We've been here for almost two days. If we experience another two days like this, I don't think I'll be able to hold out until we get out."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba tried to turn over and sit up but found his spine felt like it didn't belong to him; he couldn't move it at all. He gritted his teeth and used his hands to support his body, leaning against the boat wall and inching upwards. Finally, he managed to lift his head and saw the four people standing: Master Tashi, Master Yala, Lü Jingnan, and Sean. However, Sean was disheveled, his face bruised and discolored, his clothes stained. Unlike the other three, he seemed unharmed.

The three Tantric practitioners were certainly fine. But even Sean could stand up. Zhuo Mu Qiangba suddenly felt a surge of strength from bottom to top filling his entire body. He gritted his teeth and managed to stand up. The four standing people seemed to be helping those who were weakest. Only then did Zhuo Mu Qiangba notice the state of the serpentine boat. Of the three searchlights, only one tail light was still working. The other tail light drooped limply on the keel like a chicken with its neck twisted, flickering weakly. The headlamp was long gone, nowhere to be found. The interior of the boat was a mess, with everyone's vomit everywhere. Several backpacks, although not thrown out of the boat, had large rips in their straps, with clothes, food, and other items scattered across the boat. Except for these five people, all other crew members had expressionless faces, looking like they had mental disabilities. Zhuo Mu Qiangba knew that for those lying on the ground, as long as they were still breathing, it was the best outcome.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba first looked at the people beside him. Yue Yang and Zhang Li were breathing evenly, just unable to get up. Chu Yan was gasping but holding on. Yan Yong was also leaning against the hull, still breathing heavily. He then looked at the more seriously injured individuals. Zhang Xiang's vest was stained red with the gauze. Lü Jingnan was busy, while Sean was checking Zhang Xiang's pulse or doing something else in front of him. Meng Haoran was foaming at the mouth, attended by Master Tashi. Wang You was also foaming at the mouth, being examined by Master Yala. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at the people scattered on the floor. He lifted his leg and took a few wobbly steps like a drunkard, gradually steadying himself. He moved towards the stern, step by step. He felt like he was surveying a battlefield after the war, or a disaster area after an earthquake. Everyone lying on the ground had blackened faces, smeared with colors like face paint. Zhuo Mu Qiangba himself wasn't feeling great. In the chaos, his right eye had been struck hard by someone's fist or heel. Now, he felt like he was looking through narrowed eyes, probably swollen.

Right, where was Minmin? How was Minmin? Zhuo Mu Qiangba's heart skipped a beat. Lü Jingnan was blocking his view of Tang Min, so she was likely doing better. However, he was still worried. He staggered a couple of steps and reached Tang Min's position. He saw Minmin leaning against her own backpack, her hair falling down, covering half her face. Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully squatted down and asked gently, "Are you okay, Minmin?"

Tang Min grunted weakly twice as an answer. Zhuo Mu Qiangba pushed aside Tang Min's hair and was instantly drenched in cold sweat, wanting to ask, "Miss, what is your surname!"

Tang Min tilted her head, letting her hair cover her face again, and whispered, "I'm fine. Go and check on the others; they need help more. " Just as Zhuo Mu Qiangba was about to get up, Tang Min waved her hand as if trying to grab Zhuo Mu Qiangba's clothes, but ultimately couldn't lift it. She continued, "The backpack, the middle compartment of the backpack is filled with medical supplies."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stroked Tang Min's face through her hair and said, "Mmm, I understand. Rest well."

As he stood up again, he saw Basang at the stern struggling to kneel upright. Yue Yang, though not standing, crawled forward a couple of steps and rested his head on the gunwale, using the searchlight behind him to observe the profound darkness.

### 第四节 博浪号子

Sean was already performing oral cleansing for Li Dingming and shook his head, "There's nothing abnormal in the respiratory tract." He took a piece of gauze, placed it over Li Dingming's mouth, and prepared for artificial respiration.

"Strange," Lü Jingnan's eyebrows furrowed deeply. She said to Zhuo Mu Qiangba, "You go help Zhang Xiang with the bandaging." In critical situations, Lü Jingnan habitually reverted to her instructor persona. Zhuo Mu Qiangba obeyed and went.

Lü Jingnan examined Li Dingming's throat but found no obvious impact injury. She thought to herself, "Could it be a lung contusion?" She administered a cardiac stimulant to Li Dingming and checked his pupils with the headlamp. His pupils were dilated and showed no light reflex. She sighed and instructed Sean, "Continue with chest compressions." After speaking, she walked towards the stern. As she passed behind Sean, she glanced at him warily. This silver-haired man who had been beside Li Dingming all along made her feel uneasy.

Lü Jingnan whispered a few words in Master Yala's ear. Master Yala's gaze sharpened, and he also looked at Sean's back. Sean was performing chest compressions with all his might. Suddenly, he felt a palpable chill, and slightly startled, he didn't turn back, as if feeling nothing, continuing the compressions. However, in the darkness, a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

At this moment, Basang, Captain Hu Yang, Zhang Li, and others could also stand up. They also began helping the other injured individuals.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba finished bandaging Zhang Xiang's wound. Zhang Xiang thanked him. Zhuo Mu Qiangba was about to go see Li Dingming when a sharp whistle startled the remaining people on the boat. The whistle came from the bow; it was Yue Yang! Zhang Li then called out, "Young Master Qiangba, come here for a moment. Yue Yang has something to tell you."

It turned out that Yue Yang had been resting at the bow. As soon as he discovered something, he intended to notify Zhuo Mu Qiangba. However, when he opened his mouth, he found his voice was hoarse and raspy, completely unable to call out. He wanted to call Zhang Li, but Zhang Li had gone to the back. Chu Yan was still gasping over there, so his voice wouldn't carry far either. He decided to blow the life-saving whistle to call Zhang Li back.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba approached Yue Yang and leaned down to ask, "What's wrong?"

Yue Yang tried to speak as loudly as possible, "We can't just... drift downstream like this! We have to row! The water... the water level has dropped too much! The next surge is coming soon!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba inhaled sharply. The serpentine boat had just stabilized, and people were scattered all over the boat. He hadn't even considered this issue. He immediately ordered, "Zhang Li, fix the lighting problem quickly! Captain Hu Yang! Help check which team members can still move. We can't just lie on the boat and rest; we need to row quickly and find a place to tie up the boat first. Everyone hang in there! If you can still move, pick up your oars. We need to keep rowing!"

Yan Yong, Minmin, and others also sat up, seemingly able to pick up their oars.

Lü Jingnan came forward from the stern and said to Zhuo Mu Qiangba, "Li Dingming is gone." ...

Although Zhuo Mu Qiangba knew this was an inevitable outcome, he was stunned for a good ten seconds. Li Dingming was gone just like that. An excellent biologist, a person who loved life, he still wanted to take the most beautiful butterfly back for his daughter. But this was not the time for sadness. Zhuo Mu Qiangba could only nod slightly to acknowledge the information. Yes, he knew it; everyone on the boat knew it. In this kind of rafting operation, anything could happen. Death was unavoidable, but he just hadn't expected death to come so quickly. Two days, two people gone. How many more hours would they have to stay here? How many would eventually remain?

As the light flickered on, Zhang Li replaced the tail searchlight with a new one, having been prepared for this situation. He hurried over and reported, "The rear light is fixed." He held another light head in his hand and rushed towards the bow.

The serpentine boat accelerated again. The team members who could still move took their positions and gripped their plastic steel oars, rowing forward stroke after stroke. Their movements were mechanical, but each entry into the water was steady. No one shouted chants; their movements were still coordinated. Their hope lay in the deepest part of the boundless darkness.

Wang You and Meng Haoran were too weak to move. Zhang Xiang also wanted to pick up an oar, but Lü Jingnan told him not to, as it might reopen his wound, making the situation worse. Yue Yang's wrist bone seemed to have been dislocated by Zhuo Mu Qiangba's collision, but he didn't seem to notice. Master Yala reset his bones, but he still couldn't hold an oar. He could only lie at the bow like a scout, using his eyes to guide everyone.

Li Dingming's body lay on his backpack, as if asleep. No one disturbed him, letting him continue to lie there quietly. However, everyone gripped their oars tighter and rowed more forcefully. They had to exert all their strength, including Li Hong's. They had to row with all their might, not stopping.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's heart felt a pang as he saw the scattered people in the boat. He lifted his leg and took a few wobbly steps like a drunkard, gradually steadying himself. He moved towards the stern, step by step. He felt like he was surveying a battlefield after the war or a disaster area after an earthquake. Everyone lying on the ground had blackened faces, smeared with colors like face paint. Zhuo Mu Qiangba himself wasn't feeling great. In the chaos, his right eye had been struck hard by someone's fist or heel. Now, he felt like he was looking through narrowed eyes, probably swollen.

Right, where was Minmin? How was Minmin? Zhuo Mu Qiangba's heart skipped a beat. Lü Jingnan was blocking his view of Tang Min, so she was likely doing better. However, he was still worried. He staggered a couple of steps and reached Tang Min's position. He saw Minmin leaning against her own backpack, her hair falling down, covering half her face. Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully squatted down and asked gently, "Are you okay, Minmin?"

Tang Min grunted weakly twice as an answer. Zhuo Mu Qiangba pushed aside Tang Min's hair and was instantly drenched in cold sweat, wanting to ask, "Miss, what is your surname!"

Tang Min tilted her head, letting her hair cover her face again, and whispered, "I'm fine. Go and check on the others; they need help more." Just as Zhuo Mu Qiangba was about to get up, Tang Min waved her hand as if trying to grab Zhuo Mu Qiangba's clothes, but ultimately couldn't lift it. She continued, "The backpack, the middle compartment of the backpack is filled with medical supplies."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stroked Tang Min's face through her hair and said, "Mmm, I understand. Rest well."

As he stood up again, he saw Basang at the stern struggling to kneel upright. Yue Yang, though not standing, crawled forward a couple of steps and rested his head on the gunwale, using the searchlight behind him to observe the profound darkness.

### 第四节 潮汐巨浪

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's hands gripped the oars, staring into the boundless darkness, paddling stroke after stroke. In this desperate situation, was there really hope of getting out? How much further was it? At this moment, Old Man De Ren's words echoed in Zhuo Mu Qiangba's ears again: "Technology advances civilization and makes humans powerful, but the fundamental nature of people remains unchanged. Humans flying in space are no different from those counting stars on the grass ten thousand years ago. They also ponder, they also doubt: why do they exist in this world, and what should they do in this life? When ancient humans first did not need to frantically search for food, this question arose and will continue throughout human history. You don't need to find the ultimate answer; you only need to remember one thing. You are doing what you want to do. If you are happy doing it, and satisfied after doing it, it proves you are not wrong. Your greatest strength is perseverance, and your greatest weakness is also perseverance. My child, remember, do not neglect the potential for infinite courage within you. Let your heart be fierce. Let your aspirations align with the Buddhas. This refers to the three aeons. A single thought can transcend."

Wave after wave, they surged from the darkness and disappeared into the darkness, leaving not a trace, as if they had never appeared. Only by navigating through the peaks and troughs of the waves could one truly appreciate the danger. The small serpentine boat, caught in the countless monstrous waves, was swallowed by the waves in an instant, and in the next moment, struggled to emerge from the middle of the wave. It was like a seedling struggling to grow through rock crevices; it was always difficult, crashing against wave after wave, emerging time and time again. If knocked over by a wave, it would arduously flip over, adjust its direction, and continue forward towards the incoming waves. At its speed, it was almost crawling in this unknown sea, but it never stopped, persistently crawling forward.

This was because the oars were held in the hands of a group of people who refused to admit defeat, and the rudder was controlled by people who feared no death. No matter how fierce the waves ahead, they could not stop their determination to advance. There was no failure, only destruction.

Every so often, Zhuo Mu Qiangba would loudly ask from the back, "Have we moved away from the cliff yet?" He didn't know how much time had passed. In the darkness, there was no time. Basang's answers were always unsatisfactory, "No progress, Young Master Qiangba." "Still five hundred meters away..." "We are about five hundred meters from the cliff..."

After an unknown amount of time, facing a massive wave, Yan Yong finally couldn't help but stand up and roar, "Come on, come on! I'm not afraid of you!" Captain Hu Yang stopped him, "Yong, be quiet, be quiet. Your strength should be used for rowing!"

Yan Yong exclaimed, "We've been rowing for so long, and there's still no progress! We're facing the sea! How can this small boat possibly break through? It's impossible! How long have we been rowing? One day? Two days? I can't take it anymore! I really can't take it anymore!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba comforted him, "Don't be discouraged. We've probably only been rowing for a few hours, maybe even less than an hour."

Yue Yang added, "Moreover, I believe we are constantly moving forward. It's just that the cliff walls behind us are so vast. It's like walking at the foot of a mountain, so you can't feel the progress. Look, as long as we break out of this funnel, we can ride the wind and waves! As long as we get through, we can persevere until that time, can't we?"

As the waves crashed over them, Yan Yong gasped for breath, sitting back into the boat, feeling immensely exhausted. The cold water chilled him to the bone, making him shiver.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked Basang less frequently, as it was too strenuous. All his strength was consumed by rowing. He looked at the people beside him, Zhang Li and Yue Yang. They, like him, were woodenly, blankly, mechanically moving their oars, trying to advance a few more meters before the next wave arrived. Facing such a sea, Zhuo Mu Qiangba felt worriedly that there were too few people and the boat was too small. A thousand years ago, when those ancient people sailed their vast fleets on this underground sea, what a magnificent scene it must have been.

Finally, when Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked Basang again, he received a surprisingly delightful answer, "I can't see it anymore! I can't see the rocks!"

Yan Yong exclaimed deliriously, "We're out! We're finally out!"

Yue Yang also said, "See? Didn't I tell you? We finally made it out!" Zhang Li also smiled happily.

However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba's face remained solemn. Now, wherever the searchlights shone, there was only darkness. They had merely moved away from the cliff face, but where was the end of this vast sea? Captain Hu Yang also expressed his concern, "We just can't see the cliff anymore, but how far have we actually traveled? Does anyone know? If we haven't left the funnel yet, and twelve hours pass, those tidal forces forming large waves could wash us back!"

"Time!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba finally began to understand what his father meant when he said, "This world originally had no time." People were accustomed to checking their watches and the weather to determine time. In the absence of day and night, and mechanical clocks, time became a vague concept, as abstract as thought, something invisible and intangible. What did time really mean? Everyone used and calculated time every day, but few people seemed to pay attention to what time actually represented. This concept was like the air people breathed every day; they used it daily, but no one paid attention to studying it. Only those with doctorates and expertise researched it. Only when life neared its end did people begin to calculate time. However, whether spent lavishly or frugly, time never decreased faster because you spent it extravagantly, nor did it slow down because you meticulously calculated it. It was merely an objective existence, or perhaps, it was just a means of expression created by humans using their wisdom. Time itself did not exist?

"Does anyone know how much time has passed? We don't have time." Yan Yong murmured.

"No! That's not right!" Yue Yang suddenly questioned, "If we don't have time, then what about those ancients? How did they keep track of time a thousand years ago? Did they leave such precise times on the map? Did they have electronic watches? Or use hourglasses?"

At this moment, Master Tashi, who had not spoken, said, "It has been two hours since the last tidal surge caused a large wave."

Basang and Yan Yong immediately exclaimed, "Only two hours?"

And more people asked, "Master, how do you know?"

Master Tashi replied, "A Tantric practitioner calculates time based on their own breathing and heartbeat."

Yue Yang still asked, "But how can breathing and heartbeat accurately calculate time?"

Master Yala smiled faintly, "Breathing and heartbeat are just one set of criteria. This is difficult to explain. There is a power within the human body that can perceive changes in nature. When the sea experiences tides, the human body also undergoes very subtle changes, altering its internal environment. It's just that ordinary people don't easily notice it. But we, having undergone special training, can clearly sense the flow and change of that energy. With that as the primary basis, supplemented by other methods, we can determine the precise time without any mechanical aids. I can only explain it to you this way."

"That's great," Yue Yang rejoiced, "As long as we know the time, we can calculate the approximate voyage distance based on the paddling frequency. We are no longer aimlessly paddling forward. At least we know how far we are from our destination."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "Then, we have eight hours left until the next high tide. Let's paddle hard!"

...

Professor Fang Xin sat in front of the computer, reviewing legends and ancient sites of Mayan civilization. He meticulously browsed through every piece of information:

"A terrible disaster flooded the entire earth like a flood. The sun disappeared, and the world plunged into darkness. Chaos reigned, and people lived naked like savages. They had no shelter other than caves. Every day, they crawled out of their caves to search for food all over the mountains and plains. Just then, a person suddenly came from the south. He was tall, solemn, and majestic, with boundless magical power, capable of turning mountains into valleys and raising mountains in the valleys..."

"The capital of the Inca Empire, Cuzco, means 'Navel of the Earth.' They called themselves a small tribe living next to Lake Titicaca. Due to wars in the north, the god Viracocha guided them to find the Navel of the Earth for refuge..."

"They worshipped white stones and transported them from afar to build their sacred castles."

"They had a supreme deity named Inti, more important than the Sun God. They believed his name could not be spoken directly. When worshipping, they first placed their palms together over their chests, then knelt down, hunched their shoulders, raised their hands overhead, and prostrated themselves, keeping the deity in their hearts throughout the entire process, their eyes moving from top to bottom, not daring to look around casually..."

"A tribe called Chanka worshipped dogs and treated dogs as gods. However, strangely, they kept dogs but didn't allow them to bark; they were mute dogs..."

Professor Fang Xin's scalp tingled again. What did all this signify... He frantically shook his drowsy head, trying to stay more awake. Yet, he had to re-examine the scripture on his computer, written on birch bark with golden powder. Just then, another phone call came. Professor Fang Xin stopped thinking, rolled his wheelchair to the phone, and answered.

"Old Fang, I've got some leads on the matter you asked me to investigate. There really is a person named Hahn. He's a German atomic energy research expert. After World War II, he was snatched away by the Americans and seemed to hold a secret important position in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He later published a memoir, mainly about his experiences in atomic bomb research during World War II."

Professor Fang Xin replied, "A memoir? Where? Can it be found online? Oh, in that case, could you scan it into the computer, save it as a high-definition image, and send it to me immediately?"

"Why are you suddenly interested in this person?"

"I'll contact you after you send it. I think I need to rest. I'm getting old."

"Alright, I'll send you a text message."

Professor Fang Xin woke up to a text message on his phone. The friend had scanned and transmitted the information about Hahn to his computer. Without even washing up, the professor hurriedly opened the computer and carefully read through the scanned materials one by one. Most of the content was Hahn's memoir, including the establishment of the Haigerloch Laboratory, his position, the people involved, the progress of the work, and his thoughts about his family, etc. However, some parts were very strange, strange because Hahn himself didn't know what had happened. He only raised questions. In his memoir, he wrote: "On November 25, 1942, our research had achieved considerable results, but at this time, the enemy had already become aware of this plan we were implementing. They began sabotage operations in Czechoslovakia, and the heavy water supply lines were completely disrupted. We urgently needed more heavy water... My report has been submitted three times. We only needed a little... more... heavy water, and we could have completed the experimental reactor. I think the feasibility and power of the weapon we ultimately produced should have been well understood by the Führer, and it would have been a decisive factor in the war. But why was our small request repeatedly not approved? If only we had more protection for the heavy water production workshops and increased protection for the transportation lines, we could have successfully completed the nuclear fission reaction experiment in the shortest possible time, and then only needed to proceed with mass production. However, the reply we received from the Führer was, 'Don't rush; victory will be ours...' I once again submitted my request to the Führer, and this time the reply was, '...Don't be too hasty; we have better methods, ...' What better method could there be than a weapon of such immense power to turn the tide of the war? I can't think of any..."

Staring at the wealth of information on the computer screen, Professor Fang Xin fell into deep thought. During World War II, many German weapons were at the forefront of technology at the time, including nuclear technology. As early as 1938, Germany began research into nuclear weapons. By 1940, after Nazi Germany occupied Norway, they doubled the number of electrolytic cells at the Norsk Hydro electric plant in Norway, increasing the annual heavy water production from 3,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. At that time, British and American nuclear energy research was still in its infancy and had made little progress, even being unable to solve the heavy water extraction technology. In the spring of 1942, Heisenberg and Dopel conducted the world's first recorded neutron multiplication experiment in Leipzig. The world's first experimental reactor was also developed by the Germans. How the American and Soviet atomic bombs succeeded is common knowledge today. Large numbers of German scientists played a significant role in the successful detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States even proudly claimed that finding one Heisenberg was more useful than defeating six German divisions. It seems that before Germany's defeat and surrender, they had completely mastered the technology for atomic bomb research. However, the problem lies here: Germany did not seem to absolutely prioritize nuclear weapons research, and that lack of priority came from the highest levels. Various speculations exist today, and only the United States and the Soviet Union seem to know the truth. But after World War II, these two countries immediately turned their guns on each other, and their relationship became so tense it was breathtaking. They seemed unwilling to publicly disclose anything they learned from Germany, instead concealing it even more deeply.

In an instant, the giant fossils in the Mayan underground palace, the Great Wheel Sutra commentary, Hahn's memoir from Germany, the scenes of humans battling giant lizards that Zhuo Mu Qiangba mentioned seeing at the Hanging Temple, the final temple, Zhuo Mu Qiangba's laughing remark about seeing ten-meter-tall creatures, the curse of Gongbu Village and the Maya, all sorts of information flooded Professor Fang Xin's mind. These clues seemed to be gradually connecting. The professor slumped into his wheelchair and murmured, "What exactly are we looking for, Qiangbala?"

"What are you looking at, Qiangbala?" Old Man De Ren pushed the door open and entered.

"Ah," young Qiangbala suddenly stood up, his hands clasped nervously.

"Oh, are you looking at that set of books Aunt Dunjoo brought you from Chengdu again?"

"Mmm."

"Qiangbala, between that set of '100,000 Whys' and the Great Tripitaka, which one is better?"

"100,000 Whys." Young Qiangbala blinked his eyes.

"Why?"

"It... it tells me so many things that I didn't know." Young Qiangba clenched his fist, excited.

"Oh, then let me ask you, where is the end of this world?"

"This world has no end. The Earth is round. If you walk out from one end and circle around, you'll return to the starting point."

"Oh, then, what's outside the Earth?"

"It's the universe. The universe is vast, vast! It contains many nebulae. Our Milky Way galaxy is just one nebula, and the solar system is a small part of the Milky Way. Nine planets revolve around the sun, like nine brothers. Our Earth is the third child."

Old Man De Ren remained silent for a moment, clearly not expecting young Qiangba to have read so deeply and so carefully. He hesitated for a moment and finally asked, "Then, how big is the universe? Does it have an edge?"

"This... the book doesn't say." Young Qiangba was confused. Why didn't the book say?

Old Man De Ren smiled and left, saying, "Think about it. Just think."

Thirty years flashed by. He was back in the room where he had talked with his father. The furnishings in the house, the tables, chairs, and benches, everything remained unchanged. The only change was the person: his father had grown old, and Qiangbala had grown strong. Time changed everything, but the greatest and fastest change was in people. "Father, do you remember the question you asked me thirty years ago?"

"Oh, what question?"

"You asked me how big the universe is. Now I can tell you: the universe exploded instantaneously from a singularity. It is still expanding outwards spherically, just like the Earth. Currently, the boundary that humans can detect is 14.4 billion light-years. This is our universe. When it reaches a critical point, it will begin to contract and eventually return to its singularity state, and then explode a second time." After speaking, Qiangbala looked at his father with deep respect, this slightly bloated old man. Although he was a great sage, this knowledge was something an elder who lived in Tibet could absolutely not access. He thought his father must now understand the great difference between the world described in Buddhist scriptures and the outside world.

Unexpectedly, De Ren didn't even hesitate and asked another question, "If the universe is constantly expanding outwards as a sphere, then... what is outside of it? If it exists as a singularity, then what is beyond this singularity?" www.xiaoshuotＸt，coＭ>txt

# 第四十八章 藏地猜想：喜马拉雅海

Zhuo Mu Qiangba was rendered speechless. Old Man De Ren stood up. He was not much taller than Zhuo Mu Qiangba, who was sitting, but his wise eyes made Zhuo Mu Qiangba lower his head, feeling his own ignorance and shallowness. Old Man De Ren placed his palm on Qiangbala's forehead. Along with that surge of power came Old Man De Ren's voice, "These answers were already provided in the Great Tripitaka: Mount Meru and the mustard seed, the great chiliocosm. Meru refers to the infinitely large, and the mustard seed symbolizes the infinitely small. Whether infinitely large or infinitely small, they each form an independent world. I remember you once said that the smallest substance in the world is the atom, and later you said that atoms can be further divided into neutrons, protons, and quarks? And today you tell me the universe is a sphere 14.4 billion light-years across. Then, today I tell you, if you magnify an atom, or a neutron, to the size of the Earth, then what you see will be another universe...'"

### 第一节 没有时间的黑暗

Zhuo Mu Qiangba was rendered speechless. Old Man De Ren stood up. He was not much taller than Zhuo Mu Qiangba, who was sitting, but his wise eyes made Zhuo Mu Qiangba lower his head, feeling his own ignorance and shallowness. Old Man De Ren placed his palm on Qiangbala's forehead. Along with that surge of power came Old Man De Ren's voice, "These answers were already provided in the Great Tripitaka: Mount Meru and the mustard seed, the great chiliocosm. Meru refers to the infinitely large, and the mustard seed symbolizes the infinitely small. Whether infinitely large or infinitely small, they each form an independent world. I remember you once said that the smallest substance in the world is the atom, and later you said that atoms can be further divided into neutrons, protons, and quarks? And today you tell me the universe is a sphere 14.4 billion light-years across. Then, today I tell you, if you magnify an atom, or a neutron, to the size of the Earth, then what you see will be another universe...'"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba shuddered. An atom is composed of a nucleus formed by neutrons, and electrons revolve around the nucleus. The difference in the number of electrons determines different elements like iron, carbon, and zinc. If a neutron were magnified to the size of the sun, and an electron were magnified to the size of a planet, wouldn't each atom constitute a galaxy? This... this is truly related to what the Great Tripitaka discusses? How could Father have such astonishing scientific speculative ability?

What he didn't expect even more was Old Man De Ren continuing, "If you magnify them to the size of the universe, then what you see will be another universe, where there are also nebulae and stars, and in such a world, you can still find atoms and neutrons there..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba was bewildered. This was beyond the scope of his understanding and acceptance. He thought that perhaps Einstein would be needed to understand what Father was saying about another universe. Old Man De Ren stated, "Therefore, both large and small are worlds within a cycle, endless and without cessation."

Old Man De Ren withdrew his hand, which had performed a wisdom anointing, and sat down, saying, "Qiangbala, you haven't fully understood. You strive hard to find an outcome, but you neglect the importance of the search itself. In fact, when I asked you this question back then, I didn't expect you to find a satisfactory answer. You must know that human civilization spans over ten thousand years, encompassing all kinds of knowledge, but a single human life is rarely over a hundred years. It's impossible for a short life to grasp much knowledge. When I asked you this question back then, I only hoped that you would learn to think! Finding the answer to a question might be easy or difficult. Those are unimportant. What you need to understand is why you are looking for that answer, and what lies between the question and the answer."

"Why look for that answer and what lies between the question and the answer?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba became even more bewildered. He did what he wanted to do without often considering why he was doing it.

Old Man De Ren continued to guide him, "Do you know why you couldn't answer the question about the size of the universe? It's because your thinking is always confined by concepts like time and space. However, in the true world, there is no time and space. Think carefully. If you understand this sentence, it means you have started learning to think."

"In the true world, there is no time and space..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba suddenly opened his eyes and woke up.

In the darkness, the serpentine boat still floated gently on the river like a cradle. The searchlight, like a soft ribbon, lay on the black rock wall. Everyone was sleeping soundly in various positions. In this turbulent underground current, there were moments of such tranquility, which Zhuo Mu Qiangba had not expected. He looked at his atomic watch; it was two in the morning. It seemed everyone's biological clock was still functioning normally. As they were sleeping soundly, Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully stood up. The advantage of this serpentine boat was that its hull was made of synthetic imitation leather, which became soft after being soaked in water. Stepping on it felt like stepping on cotton, making no sound at all. After ensuring he hadn't woken anyone around him, Zhuo Mu Qiangba walked towards the stern. He was like a kindergarten teacher patrolling the children's afternoon nap, moving gently from the bow to the stern.

Everyone lay quietly, all utterly exhausted. During this time, they had braved seven more rapid sections and traveled through twenty-five river sections. Finally, based on Yue Yang's accurate calculations, they found a place to tie up the boat before the surge arrived. However, from time to time, team members would suddenly tremble, causing Zhuo Mu Qiangba considerable worry. Clearly, this was a manifestation of muscle cramps. After prolonged and excessive exertion, many team members were experiencing muscle cramps. Their muscles were too fatigued to endure. Zhuo Mu Qiangba could only hope in his heart, "Just hold on for one more day, just one more day and it will be fine."

Captain Hu Yang was snoring loudly. Minmin was curled up on his lap like a lazy cat. Lü Jingnan sat bolt upright, her angular face displaying a proud demeanor. What was Lü Jingnan thinking? Was she planning to remain single her entire life? Why didn't she find someone to spend her life with? She was so outstanding. No, she had already found someone... No! He was thinking nonsense again! Master Tashi's ears twitched. Mmm, it wasn't an illusion. Someone was definitely awake. Sean was also quite exhausted. Looking at his messy hair, where was the gentlemanly demeanor? Wang You and Meng Haoran were definitely sleeping the deepest. However, relying solely on medication was not a solution. Could they still hold on? They probably could. That empty spot... there should have been one more person. Mentor, Dingming is gone. What should I tell you when I get back!

Reaching the stern, he saw someone who was not asleep: Zhao Zhuang Sheng. The young man was leaning against the gunwale, looking out into the river. As if sensing someone approaching, he turned his head and saw Zhuo Mu Qiangba. He was about to speak when Zhuo Mu Qiangba signaled for him to speak quietly. Zhao Zhuang Sheng whispered, "Young Master Qiangba, you're not sleeping either."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Just woke up. And you? Aren't you sleeping?"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng said, "Can't sleep." Just as he finished speaking, he heard a "gurgle..." sound from his stomach.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "Are you hungry? You didn't seem to eat anything, did you?"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng replied, "Can't eat."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's expression turned grim, saying, "You have to eat even if you can't. Don't underestimate your youth, but your body might not be as resilient as mine. Is your backpack empty? I'll get you some. Eat something." Zhuo Mu Qiangba knew inwardly that being unable to eat or sleep was a major taboo in wilderness survival. If people experienced such symptoms in desperate situations, they usually couldn't hold on for more than a few days, especially when they were constantly exerting themselves. Fortunately, according to their current progress, they would reach their destination in one more day.

Zhao Zhuang Sheng stopped him, "No need to waste it, Young Master Qiangba. If I eat something, I just throw it up. I ate something earlier, but I threw it up again just now. And I have diarrhea. Damn it, I even throw up drinking plain water. I don't know what's wrong with my stomach; it's like a wrung-out cloth."

Only then did Zhuo Mu Qiangba notice that Zhao Zhuang Sheng's face was somewhat pale, indicating it wasn't just hunger. He decided firmly, "This won't do. You must also be injected with the vital fluid."

"Here..." Zhao Zhuang Sheng nodded towards the two people in front of him, "We need to save it for them to sustain their lives. I can still hold on. Aren't we going out tomorrow? I'm young, it's fine."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba nodded, "Alright. And the other two, are they okay?"

Tang Min replied, "They're fine. All physiological indicators are stable." Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at the other crew members and returned to the bow. Zhang Li and Yue Yang were both scooping water. The water in the boat was almost empty. Yan Yong sat on the ground, motionless. Yue Yang said, "Brother Yong just threw up. He even threw up the chocolate."

There were coffee-colored stains on the gunwale. Zhuo Mu Qiangba couldn't help but ask again, "Are you really okay, Yong? Do you want to eat something else?"

Yan Yong shook his head, "No need, I'm fine for now. My stomach is just churning badly, and I feel like vomiting."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba knew this was not a good sign. Once dizziness and vomiting started, it meant the body's endurance had reached its limit. It was like a taut muscle finally cramping, and it was difficult to recover in a short time, irreversible. If the serpentine boat continued to be buffeted, the various physical discomforts would worsen. Meng Haoran, Wang You, and Zhao Zhuang Sheng were all like this. Could even the experienced explorer Yan Yong not endure it?

How much further was it? Where was the exit? Was it truly in the deepest part of the darkness?

The serpentine boat set sail again, heading towards the boundless darkness. However, after this ordeal, the small boat deep in the sea had lost all sense of direction. Zhuo Mu Qiangba extended his hands, only able to sense a faint breeze, but he couldn't tell which direction the wind was blowing from—front, back, or sides. Fortunately, Master Tashi and Master Yala pointed the way for the lost boat. Everyone followed the direction indicated by the masters, continuing to row towards the depths of the boundless darkness.

Persistence, persistence. On the sea surface, waves three to five meters high existed everywhere. In fact, compared to the entire sea, it was as smooth as a mirror. However, for these people submerged in the sea, they were too small.

In this absolute darkness, sailing was torture for people. The sea surface offered no harbor. Their boat could not stop, meaning they could not sleep. Even though everyone was utterly exhausted now, they still had to persevere. Until when? No one knew.

Another eight hours passed. Yue Yang carefully marked the time on the serpentine boat's ribs. Since they lost their modern timekeeping devices, Yue Yang had been marking the time roughly calculated by Master Tashi based on heartbeat and breathing onto the boat's hull, so everyone would know how long they had been sailing on the sea.

Zhang Li picked up a water bucket and drank several large gulps. To resist hunger, most people on the boat had filled their stomachs with water. The sea surface waves were gradually calming down, but Zhuo Mu Qiangba didn't know if they had truly exited the funnel. In this dark underground world, without the assistance of instruments, they were like blind people, knowing nothing.

The atmosphere inside the boat had sunk to a point of deathly silence. Even Yan Yong was no longer shouting loudly. This quiet atmosphere made everyone feel like isolated individuals. Yes, they were completely isolated. That sense of loneliness and solitude transformed into a fear that gnawed at everyone's nerves. Those with weak willpower would start hallucinating about their imminent death. Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought, "I can't let this emotion spread." He then said, "What's wrong? Why is everyone silent?" www.xiaoshuotxt.。com＃txt＄！小＠说天＾堂＆

### 第五节 我站立着我存在

In the darkness, Zhao Zhuang Sheng felt Yue Yang's words seemed directed at him. He was puzzled, "What do you mean? Are you asking me what I'm thinking?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba then asked, "Are you asking about life's value? Heh..." He poked at the bonfire, organizing his thoughts, and said, "As far as I understand, life's value is divided into three levels: the first level is survival value, which is also life's most fundamental purpose. It manifests as the most basic material needs, including food and a healthy physique. Whether one wants to achieve great goals or accomplish earth-shattering deeds, one must first satisfy this primary condition; one must be alive. In this regard, humans are no different from animals. Once life's most basic goal is achieved, people naturally desire to achieve the second level of value, which is social value. They need to control material possessions and have their status recognized by society in some way. Perhaps this is the embodiment of your self-worth. This includes material and spiritual desires, interpersonal relationships, social background, and even forming a family and having offspring, all as external ways to embody self-worth. Simply existing in this world is not enough; people must verify their presence and necessity in this world through various means. Of course, this value is often measured by money, represented by a numerical value, which has become a consensus for most people. Although many things are priceless, people still habitually measure them with a fixed price. Therefore, if one must speak of a life price tag, it is not unreasonable."

Saying this, Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at Yue Yang again to see if he was listening. Yue Yang stared at the ground, his expression melancholic. He didn't understand Yue Yang's intention and casually replied, "You mean the third level of pursuit?" He smiled faintly, "That would naturally be the pursuit of spiritual value. In fact, people's creativity is boundless, especially when many people gather together. How much value they can create depends on their satisfaction with the value they create. If they are never satisfied, they will forever chase the second level of value. However, once a person's material needs and societal recognition reach a level of satisfaction, they will turn to pursue the higher levels of value. That value should be something very vague. Talented people will focus on their talents, such as artists and thinkers. For ordinary people, this spiritual need often requires the help of religion or other forms of expression. In fact, there is not much of an absolute boundary between the second and third levels of value realization. For example, some people are very indifferent to the realization of the second level of value. They only need to satisfy the first level of value and then fully pursue the realization of spiritual value. These people have extremely low demands for material possessions and social recognition, indulging in their spiritual world. It's hard to say whether they are right or wrong, isn't it?"

Yue Yang threw the branches into the bonfire and said incredulously, "Is this really your understanding, Young Master Qiangba?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "I know either way."

Yue Yang smiled, his expression turning solemn again. He then asked, "Why, Young Master Qiangba, why do some people change for the second level of value, even becoming completely... different from before? Is the magic of the second level of value really that terrifying?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba sighed, "Perhaps he is too eager to affirm his existence through a certain social value. In fact, many people subconsciously have this mentality. For example, those who work desperately, those who strive desperately to get certified, and those who are past the age for blind dates, subconsciously feel that they are not fully recognized by society, or have not obtained the normal social status of normal people. It's just that some people prefer extreme forms." Thinking of Tong Fangzheng, his expression dimmed.

Yue Yang said dejectedly, "Extreme... Can you really disregard everything?"

Suddenly, Zhuo Mu Qiangba seemed to have thought of something and looked up, asking, "Are you talking about Zhuang Sheng?" He looked at Yue Yang's bandaged arm and then asked, "Your hand injury, was it not an accidental injury caused by the sudden attack of the giant lizard?"

Yue Yang smiled wryly and told Zhuo Mu Qiangba the whole story from beginning to end.

Finally, Yue Yang said, "It seems that in the face of profit, friendship, promises, and even vows can all change. I remember someone said that time changes everything, but I didn't expect it to change so quickly, so thoroughly. " Zhuo Mu Qiangba also fell into thought. The two were silent for a moment, with only the crackling of the bonfire.

After a while, Yue Yang looked up, seemingly trying to soothe his repressed emotions. He sighed and said, "Ah, it's finally over. Perhaps he had his reasons. Young Master Qiangba, regarding this matter, besides the instructor, please don't tell anyone else, okay?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba nodded. Yue Yang looked up at the night sky. A few stars twinkled there. He couldn't help but praise, "That's great! The thick clouds above Shambhala have dispersed again tonight, and we can see the starry sky again."

"Really?" Zhuo Mu Qiangba also looked up. However, both he and Yue Yang quickly realized that those stars were not right. They weren't just twinkling starlight; those stars were moving rapidly, but not in the usual trajectory of stars. Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up, frowning, "Strange."

### 第五节 最后的期待

"Father, according to what you said, is believing in religion entirely beneficial and without harm? Then what about holy wars? Is fighting for faith also a good thing? I've seen people who need faith; they do things that ordinary people wouldn't dare to do because of their fervent faith."

"Qiangbala, my child, you clearly have only a superficial, shallow understanding of religion. I don't know if this is one reason why you dislike religion. Religion is just a tool; it's not inherently wrong. No doctrine teaches people to have evil as their faith. Just like a kitchen knife, it can create delicious dishes in the hands of a chef, but it becomes a tool for bloodshed in the hands of a villain. But the kitchen knife itself exists because people need it. As for the believers you mention, I firmly believe that the mistakes they make due to faith have certain limitations. This limitation comes from their inner unease. In fact, the truly terrifying ones are those who have no faith at all. You will understand. Those who kill without any reason, their depravity stems from their loss of humanity. If a person loses their faith, then life becomes meaningless to them. They have nothing to fear, and they can even do things more terrifying than animal instincts. They stop at nothing, and no cruelty is too much for them."

"No religion teaches people how to make mistakes. Only those who make mistakes try to alleviate their sense of guilt."

"I have no faith."

"Really? Then let me ask you, do you feel guilty when you lie?"

"Of course, I do."

"When you do something, do you first consider whether it can be done?"

"No."

"Then, when you are doing this thing, do you believe you will succeed?"

"Yes."

"When you are doing this thing, do you firmly believe that if you work hard and persevere, you will definitely succeed?"

"Yes, I do! I'm sure!"

"You see, my child, this is faith."

"I have... faith?"

"Yes, except for the devil, everyone has their own faith."

"I have faith!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. He didn't understand what was happening. In this dark, enclosed, cold space, unable to bear the hunger, he had somehow fallen asleep again in a daze. The sky was as dark as ink as usual, and even the headlamp had run out of power and gone out. In the darkness, no one could see anyone else. He only knew that Minmin was leaning against his legs. It seemed he wouldn't wake up tonight. Only the gnawing pain in his abdomen reminded him that he was still hovering on the edge of hell. He asked himself, "Am I still alive?" Yes, he was still alive. Since he was still alive, he had to do something.

As soon as he moved, Minmin whispered, "You... you're awake?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Try not to talk. Just relax. It will pass. All of this."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully placed Minmin's head on the boat and struggled to turn over. At this moment, the one-meter-high gunwale of the serpentine boat seemed like an insurmountable obstacle to him. He crawled on the ground, truly lacking the strength to support his body. Moreover, what was the point of getting up? Getting up would only lead to more darkness. Darkness enveloped them, and darkness reminded them that this was the Styx River, where death was the sole ruler.

After about an hour, he was woken up by Yue Yang. "Young Master Qiangba..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. Yue Yang said, "The second wave of rising water is probably coming soon."

"What! So soon!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was startled, his sleepiness completely gone. He turned over and stood up, asking, "Are you sure?"

Yue Yang handed him the open laptop, saying, "Young Master Qiangba, look. This is another abstract symbol on the map that we haven't fully understood. Why are the marked times so abstract that even Master Yala and the others couldn't identify them? After repeated observation, I found that these symbols are not a complete animal, but a combination of two animals. Look at this one, a bull's head and a chicken's tail. And this one, a tiger's face and a monkey's body. That's why it's so difficult to understand. Then I thought of the poem from Gongbu Village, which says the warriors only rest twice a day. Why twice? If the animals representing time are not one, but two... Also, the times recorded by our observation points clearly show that the Brahmaputra River rises twice every day, just that one time is more than the other. If we restore the two parts of the animals, then it would be this time period."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What time is it?"

Yue Yang replied, "It's 5 AM."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba remarked, "I slept for so long."

Yue Yang suggested, "Young Master Qiangba, look, shouldn't we wake everyone up..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba responded, "Okay, wake everyone up. This matter cannot be overlooked."

Everyone was woken up groggily. Some complained that they had just fallen asleep, while others seemed not to have slept at all. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at them with concern. "Hey, everyone, pull yourselves together!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba encouraged them, "Listen, the second wave of water is coming soon. If you don't want to fall behind so quickly, get energized! Hold onto the boat tightly!"

"What!"

"It's coming again!"

"Oh my gosh!" The new team members cried out in unison. However, an ominous sound quickly silenced them, "Buzzing..." "Mmm... mmm..." Ripples appeared on the water surface again. Yue Yang's prediction was correct. This was a warning signal that made everyone's hearts clench.

Roaring forward and then whistling away, the silver dragon was like the sanitation crew of this underground kingdom, cleaning the cave once in a while. Its irresistible power made people tremble. This time, the surge was even greater and more rapid. The entire keel boat was tossed up from the water like a speed boat several times. The spray from the bow splashed everyone on the boat, soaking them. Everyone gripped the gunwales, their knuckles turning white. They all knew that if they let go, they would fall behind Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Behind them lay endless darkness. No one knew where the turbulent currents would carry them, nor how long they could endure within these currents. Yue Yang, holding onto the bow of the boat, watched vigilantly. The main rope, stretched taut, continuously tightened under the immense force of the water, twisting tightly into the keel, making a "creaking" sound. Yue Yang's heart tightened like the keel. He knew that if the main rope broke under such great force, it would be fortunate if the entire boat was only pushed back to the starting position. If the boat got stuck somewhere or capsized and broke, it would undoubtedly be a complete annihilation. He had made up his mind: they had to endure this wave of surging water, and next time they tied up, they should use at least two main ropes.

With a "clatter," Yue Yang's vision suddenly turned black. Light shone from behind him. It turned out that the immense impact had tossed the keel boat high up, and the searchlight at the bow collided with a hanging stalactite overhead, immediately extinguishing. Then came an "ouch," and someone cried out.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's voice commanded, "Careful! Watch out for the stalactites overhead! Hold onto the gunwales, lie down, quickly lie down!"

A dark shadow swept past overhead. Zhao Zhuang Sheng saw it clearly, reached out, and at that very moment, the surging water suddenly subsided, and then rose sharply again. The stern of the serpentine boat suddenly tilted upwards. Li Dingming and Zhao Zhuang Sheng simultaneously slipped their fingers and were thrown into the air. Basang and Master Yala, sitting behind them, reached out and firmly grabbed their ankles. Master Yala said to Zhao Zhuang Sheng, "Got you!"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng instead shouted, "Let go of me!" Master Yala sat solemnly and recited scriptures, regardless of Zhao Zhuang Sheng's struggles, unable to break free. Zhao Zhuang Sheng screamed, "Li Hong! Li Hong fell!" Yue Yang, at the bow, heard this and his heart tightened!

Li Dingming was thrown heavily back onto the boat by Basang. Then the boat swayed again. Basang said in a hoarse voice, "Grab your backpacks!"

At this moment, the serpentine boat was like a car speeding down a rocky slope, shaking up and down with the water flow. The entire process lasted for several minutes, and the turbulent waves gradually subsided. Among these people, only the veteran team members who had been to the Americas could truly appreciate the power of the turbulent waves and their irresistible force. Recalling it, it was a ceaseless bumping, as if all their bones had been shaken loose, and even their consciousness and thoughts became blurred due to the violent shaking. Only a clear point of clarity remained in their minds, controlling their fingers to hold on tightly, knowing that nothing else mattered. The current situation was the same. The hands gripping the gunwales seemed to gather all their strength, while the rest of their bodies had lost all sensation. Even though the waves had calmed, they would need to rest for a long time to regain strength in their muscles. Meng Haoran, not understanding the reason, stumbled as soon as he stood up. He knelt on the boat, gripping his backpack with both hands, only to find his arms trembling slightly. Turning to look, he saw that not only himself but also Li Dingming was trembling even more severely.

After a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, Master Tashi was the first to stand up, take a few steady steps forward, and approach Zhang Xiang, asking, "Are you okay?" He clearly saw that a huge stone pillar had scraped heavily against Zhang Xiang's back. In the chaos, that "ouch" was Zhang Xiang's cry.

Zhang Xiang's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his face was pale. He smiled and said, "I'm fine, just bumped into it. *Hiss*!" Master Tashi gently lifted Zhang Xiang's vest and saw that Zhang Xiang's back was scraped off a large piece of flesh, bleeding profusely. Tang Min, seeing this from behind, exclaimed, "Oh my!"

Master Tashi said to Tang Min, "I think we need something to stop the bleeding."

Tang Min released her grip on the gunwale, her hands trembling. She tried to open the backpack zipper several times but couldn't. Master Tashi came to help. Tang Min instructed, "The gauze is in the second pocket, followed by bandages. The disinfectant is in the third compartment on the left." Lü Jingnan also came to help.

Yue Yang clenched his fists. His limbs could move. He leaned sideways and grabbed Zhang Li, saying, "Come and take a look at this light; it seems to be damaged." Chu Yan, standing nearby, commented, "It looks like it's broken. I saw that pillar directly hit the lamp cover."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and asked Yan Yong and Captain Hu Yang, two exploration captains who hadn't experienced the tidal surge, "Are you two alright?" Both shook their heads and simultaneously looked towards the injured Zhang Xiang.

Yan Yong stated, "Alright, we've survived again." As he spoke, he tried to stand up, but his knees went weak, and he stumbled forward, grabbing Zhang Li's backpack with his hands, managing not to fall to the ground. He then realized the right side was empty and asked, "Where's Li Hong?"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng roared. As Master Yala loosened his grip, he lunged into the Styx River. Basang shouted, "Nonsense! Don't go looking for death!"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was also startled. Li Hong was right behind him. He had let go without making a sound. At that time, everyone had their heads bowed, and no one noticed Li Hong sweeping past them. Looking at the suddenly rising ten-meter-high tidal wave, if he had been washed away during the surge, there would be no finding him.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba and the others went to the stern of the boat and shone the searchlight onto the water surface, looking for Zhao Zhuang Sheng's figure. After a moment, Zhao Zhuang Sheng emerged from the dark river, angrily striking the water surface with his hands, splashing large amounts of water, and cursing, "Li Hong fell, why didn't you grab him! You're all so capable! Hmph! *Cough cough*... *Gurgle gurgle*..." He then sank again...

Yue Yang called from the stern, "Skinny, come up quickly! There are more small waves behind you; you'll be swept away!" But Zhao Zhuang Sheng didn't answer. He waved his hands in the air, seemingly not quite right.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Remember to maintain contact and be careful." Yue Yang went off happily to discuss this with Zhang Li and Basang. Zhuo Mu Qiangba then called Professor Fang Xin and informed him of this information. While traveling, Zhuo Mu Qiangba maintained daily contact with the professor, exchanging information. The closer they got to the Gate of Hell, the longer their phone calls became. He knew that after this departure, the Styx River would separate them by thousands of years, and their return date was uncertain.

The next day, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Basang, and others turned south, while Zhuo Mu Qiangba led the remaining team members north. Midway, he received a call from Yue Yang. Yue Yang said on the phone, "Young Master Qiangba, the inference has been confirmed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "What did you say! There really is a passage there?"

Yue Yang replied, "Yes, but it's not marked on the map because it's a sieve-like passage with many entrances, each only the size of a fist. We used a camera to probe it and found that the tunnels inside are equally narrow. I'll explain when I get back. In any case, this entrance is unusable."

Standing on the platform of the Gate of Hell, Meng Haoran sighed, "Flying stream straight down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way falls from nine heavens..."

Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent natural scenery, as beautiful as a fairy land in a painting, like an illusion in a dream. The silver ribbon was slightly larger than when they had last visited, its momentum increasingly majestic. Below the cliff face, the waves churned like ten thousand galloping horses, charging forward relentlessly, evoking the sentiment of "Yellow River water comes from the heavens, flowing to the sea and never returning."

Li Hong cautiously asked Master Yala, who had been there before, "Why don't I see the gate?"

Master Yala stared at the rolling waves below and replied, "It's in the water."

"Ah!" Li Hong looked down the cliff face. Whirlpools passed one after another beneath their feet. Just watching them was dizzying. Such turbulent currents, even if an iron bull fell in, would disappear without a trace!

While Meng Haoran was lost in his poetic fervor, Li Dingming seized his SLR camera and began taking pictures.

Minmin, who was also not visiting for the first time, was captivated by a beautiful butterfly on Lü Jingnan's shoulder. The butterfly's wings fluttered slowly in the sunlight, but its few feet were firmly stuck to Lü Jingnan's shoulder, not leaving even when he shook his shoulders to capture the scenery.

Tang Min curiously asked, "Brother Dingming, when did this butterfly fly here? Why isn't it leaving?"

Li Dingming looked and smiled, "I don't know why. Since childhood, I've always attracted butterflies. Every time I went on an outing, a group of butterflies followed me. My daughter is the same; all the children affectionately call her Butterfly Princess. When I came out this time, I promised her I'd bring back the most beautiful butterfly I'd never seen."

While Li Dingming and Tang Min were talking, Master Yala and Master Tashi glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, "Contracted!" Both masters had the same thought flash through their minds.

### 第四节 潮汐巨浪

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's hands gripped the oars, staring into the boundless darkness, paddling stroke after stroke. In this desperate situation, was there really hope of getting out? How much further was it? At this moment, Old Man De Ren's words echoed in Zhuo Mu Qiangba's ears again: "Technology advances civilization and makes humans powerful, but the fundamental nature of people remains unchanged. Humans flying in space are no different from those counting stars on the grass ten thousand years ago. They also ponder, they also doubt: why do they exist in this world, and what should they do in this life? When ancient humans first did not need to frantically search for food, this question arose and will continue throughout human history. You don't need to find the ultimate answer; you only need to remember one thing. You are doing what you want to do. If you are happy doing it, and satisfied after doing it, it proves you are not wrong. Your greatest strength is perseverance, and your greatest weakness is also perseverance. My child, remember, do not neglect the potential for infinite courage within you. Let your heart be fierce. Let your aspirations align with the Buddhas. This refers to the three aeons. A single thought can transcend."

Wave after wave, they surged from the darkness and disappeared into the darkness, leaving not a trace, as if they had never appeared. Only by navigating through the peaks and troughs of the waves could one truly appreciate the danger. The small serpentine boat, caught in the countless monstrous waves, was swallowed by the waves in an instant, and in the next moment, struggled to emerge from the middle of the wave. It was like a seedling struggling to grow through rock crevices; it was always difficult, crashing against wave after wave, emerging time and time again. If knocked over by a wave, it would arduously flip over, adjust its direction, and continue forward towards the incoming waves. At its speed, it was almost crawling in this unknown sea, but it never stopped, persistently crawling forward.

This was because the oars were held in the hands of a group of people who refused to admit defeat, and the rudder was controlled by people who feared no death. No matter how fierce the waves ahead, they could not stop their determination to advance. There was no failure, only destruction.

Every so often, Zhuo Mu Qiangba would loudly ask from the back, "Have we moved away from the cliff yet?" He didn't know how much time had passed. In the darkness, there was no time. Basang's answers were always unsatisfactory, "No progress, Young Master Qiangba." "Still five hundred meters away..." "We are about five hundred meters from the cliff..."

After an unknown amount of time, facing a massive wave, Yan Yong finally couldn't help but stand up and roar, "Come on, come on! I'm not afraid of you!" Captain Hu Yang stopped him, "Yong, be quiet, be quiet. Your strength should be used for rowing!"

Yan Yong exclaimed, "We've been rowing for so long, and there's still no progress! We're facing the sea! How can this small boat possibly break through? It's impossible! How long have we been rowing? One day? Two days? I can't take it anymore! I really can't take it anymore!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba comforted him, "Don't be discouraged. We've probably only been rowing for a few hours, maybe even less than an hour."

Yue Yang added, "Moreover, I believe we are constantly moving forward. It's just that the cliff walls behind us are so vast. It's like walking at the foot of a mountain, so you can't feel the progress. Look, as long as we break out of this funnel, we can ride the wind and waves! As long as we get through, we can persevere until that time, can't we?"

As the waves crashed over them, Yan Yong gasped for breath, sitting back into the boat, feeling immensely exhausted. The cold water chilled him to the bone, making him shiver.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked Basang less frequently, as it was too strenuous. All his strength was consumed by rowing. He looked at the people beside him, Zhang Li and Yue Yang. They, like him, were woodenly, blankly, mechanically moving their oars, trying to advance a few more meters before the next wave arrived. Facing such a sea, Zhuo Mu Qiangba felt worriedly that there were too few people and the boat was too small. A thousand years ago, when those ancient people sailed their vast fleets on this underground sea, what a magnificent scene it must have been.

Finally, when Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked Basang again, he received a surprisingly delightful answer, "I can't see it anymore! I can't see the rocks!"

Yan Yong exclaimed deliriously, "We're out! We're finally out!"

Yue Yang also said, "See? Didn't I tell you? We finally made it out!" Zhang Li also smiled happily.

However, Zhuo Mu Qiangba's face remained solemn. Now, wherever the searchlights shone, there was only darkness. They had merely moved away from the cliff face, but where was the end of this vast sea? Captain Hu Yang also expressed his concern, "We just can't see the cliff anymore, but how far have we actually traveled? Does anyone know? If we haven't left the funnel yet, and twelve hours pass, those tidal forces forming large waves could wash us back!"

"Time!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba finally began to understand what his father meant when he said, "This world originally had no time." People were accustomed to checking their watches and the weather to determine time. In the absence of day and night, and mechanical clocks, time became a vague concept, as abstract as thought, something invisible and intangible. What did time really mean? Everyone used and calculated time every day, but few people seemed to pay attention to what time actually represented. This concept was like the air people breathed every day; they used it daily, but no one paid attention to studying it. Only those with doctorates and expertise researched it. Only when life neared its end did people begin to calculate time. However, whether spent lavishly or frugly, time never decreased faster because you spent it extravagantly, nor did it slow down because you meticulously calculated it. It was merely an objective existence, or perhaps, it was just a means of expression created by humans using their wisdom. Time itself did not exist?

"Does anyone know how much time has passed? We don't have time." Yan Yong murmured.

"No! That's not right!" Yue Yang suddenly questioned, "If we don't have time, then what about those ancients? How did they keep track of time a thousand years ago? Did they leave such precise times on the map? Did they have electronic watches? Or use hourglasses?"

At this moment, Master Tashi, who had not spoken, said, "It has been two hours since the last tidal surge caused a large wave."

Basang and Yan Yong immediately exclaimed, "Only two hours?"

And more people asked, "Master, how do you know?"

Master Tashi replied, "A Tantric practitioner calculates time based on their own breathing and heartbeat."

Yue Yang still asked, "But how can breathing and heartbeat accurately calculate time?"

Master Yala smiled faintly, "Breathing and heartbeat are just one set of criteria. This is difficult to explain. There is a power within the human body that can perceive changes in nature. When the sea experiences tides, the human body also undergoes very subtle changes, altering its internal environment. It's just that ordinary people don't easily notice it. But we, having undergone special training, can clearly sense the flow and change of that energy. With that as the primary basis, supplemented by other methods, we can determine the precise time without any mechanical aids. I can only explain it to you this way."

"That's great," Yue Yang rejoiced, "As long as we know the time, we can calculate the approximate voyage distance based on the paddling frequency. We are no longer aimlessly paddling forward. At least we know how far we are from our destination."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stated, "Then, we have eight hours left until the next high tide. Let's paddle hard!"

...

Professor Fang Xin sat in front of the computer, reviewing legends and ancient sites of Mayan civilization. He meticulously browsed through every piece of information:

"A terrible disaster flooded the entire earth like a flood. The sun disappeared, and the world plunged into darkness. Chaos reigned, and people lived naked like savages. They had no shelter other than caves. Every day, they crawled out of their caves to search for food all over the mountains and plains. Just then, a person suddenly came from the south. He was tall, solemn, and majestic, with boundless magical power, capable of turning mountains into valleys and raising mountains in the valleys..."

"The capital of the Inca Empire, Cuzco, means 'Navel of the Earth.' They called themselves a small tribe living next to Lake Titicaca. Due to wars in the north, the god Viracocha guided them to find the Navel of the Earth for refuge..."

"They worshipped white stones and transported them from afar to build their sacred castles."

"They had a supreme deity named Inti, more important than the Sun God. They believed his name could not be spoken directly. When worshipping, they first placed their palms together over their chests, then knelt down, hunched their shoulders, raised their hands overhead, and prostrated themselves, keeping the deity in their hearts throughout the entire process, their eyes moving from top to bottom, not daring to look around casually..."

"A tribe called Chanka worshipped dogs and treated dogs as gods. However, strangely, they kept dogs but didn't allow them to bark; they were mute dogs..."

Professor Fang Xin's scalp tingled again. What did all this signify... He frantically shook his drowsy head, trying to stay more awake. Yet, he had to re-examine the scripture on his computer, written on birch bark with golden powder. Just then, another phone call came. Professor Fang Xin stopped thinking, rolled his wheelchair to the phone, and answered.

"Old Fang, I've got some leads on the matter you asked me to investigate. There really is a person named Hahn. He's a German atomic energy research expert. After World War II, he was snatched away by the Americans and seemed to hold a secret important position in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He later published a memoir, mainly about his experiences in atomic bomb research during World War II."

Professor Fang Xin replied, "A memoir? Where? Can it be found online? Oh, in that case, could you scan it into the computer, save it as a high-definition image, and send it to me immediately?"

"Why are you suddenly interested in this person?"

"I'll contact you after you send it. I think I need to rest. I'm getting old."

"Alright, I'll send you a text message."

Professor Fang Xin woke up to a text message on his phone. The friend had scanned and transmitted the information about Hahn to his computer. Without even washing up, the professor hurriedly opened the computer and carefully read through the scanned materials one by one. Most of the content was Hahn's memoir, including the establishment of the Haigerloch Laboratory, his position, the people involved, the progress of the work, and his thoughts about his family, etc. However, some parts were very strange, strange because Hahn himself didn't know what had happened. He only raised questions. In his memoir, he wrote: "On November 25, 1942, our research had achieved considerable results, but at this time, the enemy had already become aware of this plan we were implementing. They began sabotage operations in Czechoslovakia, and the heavy water supply lines were completely disrupted. We urgently needed more heavy water... My report has been submitted three times. We only needed a little... more... heavy water, and we could have completed the experimental reactor. I think the feasibility and power of the weapon we ultimately produced should have been well understood by the Führer, and it would have been a decisive factor in the war. But why was our small request repeatedly not approved? If only we had more protection for the heavy water production workshops and increased protection for the transportation lines, we could have successfully completed the nuclear fission reaction experiment in the shortest possible time, and then only needed to proceed with mass production. However, the reply we received from the Führer was, 'Don't rush; victory will be ours...' I once again submitted my request to the Führer, and this time the reply was, '...Don't be too hasty; we have better methods, ...' What better method could there be than a weapon of such immense power to turn the tide of the war? I can't think of any..."

Staring at the wealth of information on the computer screen, Professor Fang Xin fell into deep thought. During World War II, many German weapons were at the forefront of technology at the time, including nuclear technology. As early as 1938, Germany began research into nuclear weapons. By 1940, after Nazi Germany occupied Norway, they doubled the number of electrolytic cells at the Norsk Hydro electric plant in Norway, increasing the annual heavy water production from 3,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. At that time, British and American nuclear energy research was still in its infancy and had made little progress, even being unable to solve the heavy water extraction technology. In the spring of 1942, Heisenberg and Dopel conducted the world's first recorded neutron multiplication experiment in Leipzig. The world's first experimental reactor was also developed by the Germans. How the American and Soviet atomic bombs succeeded is common knowledge today. Large numbers of German scientists played a significant role in the successful detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States even proudly claimed that finding one Heisenberg was more useful than defeating six German divisions. It seems that before Germany's defeat and surrender, they had completely mastered the technology for atomic bomb research. However, the problem lies here: Germany did not seem to absolutely prioritize nuclear weapons research, and that lack of priority came from the highest levels. Various speculations exist today, and only the United States and the Soviet Union seem to know the truth. But after World War II, these two countries immediately turned their guns on each other, and their relationship became so tense it was breathtaking. They seemed unwilling to publicly disclose anything they learned from Germany, instead concealing it even more deeply.

In an instant, the giant fossils in the Mayan underground palace, the Great Wheel Sutra commentary, Hahn's memoir from Germany, the scenes of humans battling giant lizards that Zhuo Mu Qiangba mentioned seeing at the Hanging Temple, the final temple, Zhuo Mu Qiangba's laughing remark about seeing ten-meter-tall creatures, the curse of Gongbu Village and the Maya, all sorts of information flooded Professor Fang Xin's mind. These clues seemed to be gradually connecting. The professor slumped into his wheelchair and murmured, "What exactly are we looking for, Qiangbala?"

"What are you looking at, Qiangbala?" Old Man De Ren pushed the door open and entered.

"Ah," young Qiangbala suddenly stood up, his hands clasped nervously.

"Oh, are you looking at that set of books Aunt Dunjoo brought you from Chengdu again?"

"Mmm."

"Qiangbala, between that set of '100,000 Whys' and the Great Tripitaka, which one is better?"

"100,000 Whys." Young Qiangba blinked his eyes.

"Why?"

"It... it tells me so many things that I didn't know." Young Qiangba clenched his fist, excited.

"Oh, then let me ask you, where is the end of this world?"

"This world has no end. The Earth is round. If you walk out from one end and circle around, you'll return to the starting point."

"Oh, then, what's outside the Earth?"

"It's the universe. The universe is vast, vast! It contains many nebulae. Our Milky Way galaxy is just one nebula, and the solar system is a small part of the Milky Way. Nine planets revolve around the sun, like nine brothers. Our Earth is the third child."

Old Man De Ren remained silent for a moment, clearly not expecting young Qiangba to have read so deeply and so carefully. He hesitated for a moment and finally asked, "Then, how big is the universe? Does it have an edge?"

"This... the book doesn't say." Young Qiangba was confused. Why didn't the book say?

Old Man De Ren smiled and left, saying, "Think about it. Just think."

Thirty years flashed by. He was back in the room where he had talked with his father. The furnishings in the house, the tables, chairs, and benches, everything remained unchanged. The only change was the person: his father had grown old, and Qiangbala had grown strong. Time changed everything, but the greatest and fastest change was in people. "Father, do you remember the question you asked me thirty years ago?"

"Oh, what question?"

"You asked me how big the universe is. Now I can tell you: the universe exploded instantaneously from a singularity. It is still expanding outwards spherically, just like the Earth. Currently, the boundary that humans can detect is 14.4 billion light-years. This is our universe. When it reaches a critical point, it will begin to contract and eventually return to its singularity state, and then explode a second time." After speaking, Qiangbala looked at his father with deep respect, this slightly bloated old man. Although he was a great sage, this knowledge was something an elder who lived in Tibet could absolutely not access. He thought his father must now understand the great difference between the world described in Buddhist scriptures and the outside world.

Unexpectedly, De Ren didn't even hesitate and asked another question, "If the universe is constantly expanding outwards as a sphere, then... what is outside of it? If it exists as a singularity, then what is beyond this singularity?"

"Father, according to what you said, is believing in religion entirely beneficial and without harm? Then what about holy wars? Is fighting for faith also a good thing? I've seen people who need faith; they do things that ordinary people wouldn't dare to do because of their fervent faith."

"Qiangbala, my child, you clearly have only a superficial, shallow understanding of religion. I don't know if this is one reason why you dislike religion. Religion is just a tool; it's not inherently wrong. No doctrine teaches people to have evil as their faith. Just like a kitchen knife, it can create delicious dishes in the hands of a chef, but it becomes a tool for bloodshed in the hands of a villain. But the kitchen knife itself exists because people need it. As for the believers you mention, I firmly believe that the mistakes they make due to faith have certain limitations. This limitation comes from their inner unease. In fact, the truly terrifying ones are those who have no faith at all. You will understand. Those who kill without any reason, their depravity stems from their loss of humanity. If a person loses their faith, then life becomes meaningless to them. They have nothing to fear, and they can even do things more terrifying than animal instincts. They stop at nothing, and no cruelty is too much for them."

"No religion teaches people how to make mistakes. Only those who make mistakes try to alleviate their sense of guilt."

"I have no faith."

"Really? Then let me ask you, do you feel guilty when you lie?"

"Of course, I do."

"When you do something, do you first consider whether it can be done?"

"No."

"Then, when you are doing this thing, do you believe you will succeed?"

"Yes."

"When you are doing this thing, do you firmly believe that if you work hard and persevere, you will definitely succeed?"

"Yes, I do! I'm sure!"

"You see, my child, this is faith."

"I have... faith?"

"Yes, except for the devil, everyone has their own faith."

"I have faith!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. He didn't understand what was happening. In this dark, enclosed, cold space, unable to bear the hunger, he had somehow fallen asleep again in a daze. The sky was as dark as ink as usual, and even the headlamp had run out of power and gone out. In the darkness, no one could see anyone else. He only knew that Minmin was leaning against his legs. It seemed he wouldn't wake up tonight. Only the gnawing pain in his abdomen reminded him that he was still hovering on the edge of hell. He asked himself, "Am I still alive?" Yes, he was still alive. Since he was still alive, he had to do something.

As soon as he moved, Minmin whispered, "You... you're awake?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Try not to talk. Just relax. It will pass. All of this."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully placed Minmin's head on the boat and struggled to turn over. At this moment, the one-meter-high gunwale of the serpentine boat seemed like an insurmountable obstacle to him. He crawled on the ground, truly lacking the strength to support his body. Moreover, what was the point of getting up? Getting up would only lead to more darkness. Darkness enveloped them, and darkness reminded them that this was the Styx River, where death was the sole ruler.

After about an hour, he was woken up by Yue Yang. "Young Master Qiangba, wake up..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. Yue Yang said, "The second wave of rising water is probably coming soon."

"What! So soon!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was startled, his sleepiness completely gone. He turned over and stood up, asking, "Are you sure?"

Yue Yang handed him the open laptop, saying, "Young Master Qiangba, look. This is another abstract symbol on the map that we haven't fully understood. Why are the marked times so abstract that even Master Yala and the others couldn't identify them? After repeated observation, I found that these symbols are not a complete animal, but a combination of two animals. Look at this one, a bull's head and a chicken's tail. And this one, a tiger's face and a monkey's body. That's why it's so difficult to understand. Then I thought of the poem from Gongbu Village, which says the warriors only rest twice a day. Why twice? If the animals representing time are not one, but two... Also, the times recorded by our observation points clearly show that the Brahmaputra River rises twice every day, just that one time is more than the other. If we restore the two parts of the animals, then it would be this time period."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What time is it?"

Yue Yang replied, "It's 5 AM."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba remarked, "I slept for so long."

Yue Yang suggested, "Young Master Qiangba, look, shouldn't we wake everyone up..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba responded, "Okay, wake everyone up. This matter cannot be overlooked."

Everyone was woken up groggily. Some complained that they had just fallen asleep, while others seemed not to have slept at all. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at them with concern. "Hey, everyone, pull yourselves together!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba encouraged them, "Listen, the second wave of water is coming soon. If you don't want to fall behind so quickly, get energized! Hold onto the boat tightly!"

"What!"

"It's coming again!"

"Oh my gosh!" The new team members cried out in unison. However, an ominous sound quickly silenced them, "Buzzing..." "Mmm... mmm..." Ripples appeared on the water surface again. Yue Yang's prediction was correct. This was a warning signal that made everyone's hearts clench.

Roaring forward and then whistling away, the silver dragon was like the sanitation crew of this underground kingdom, cleaning the cave once in a while. Its irresistible power made people tremble. This time, the surge was even greater and more rapid. The entire keel boat was tossed up from the water like a speed boat several times. The spray from the bow splashed everyone on the boat, soaking them. Everyone gripped the gunwales, their knuckles turning white. They all knew that if they let go, they would fall behind Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Behind them lay endless darkness. No one knew where the turbulent currents would carry them, nor how long they could endure within these currents. Yue Yang, holding onto the bow of the boat, watched vigilantly. The main rope, stretched taut, continuously tightened under the immense force of the water, twisting tightly into the keel, making a "creaking" sound. Yue Yang's heart tightened like the keel. He knew that if the main rope broke under such great force, it would be fortunate if the entire boat was only pushed back to the starting position. If the boat got stuck somewhere or capsized and broke, it would undoubtedly be a complete annihilation. He had made up his mind: they had to endure this wave of surging water, and next time they tied up, they should use at least two main ropes.

With a "clatter," Yue Yang's vision suddenly turned black. Light shone from behind him. It turned out that the immense impact had tossed the keel boat high up, and the searchlight at the bow collided with a hanging stalactite overhead, immediately extinguishing. Then came an "ouch," and someone cried out.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's voice commanded, "Careful! Watch out for the stalactites overhead! Hold onto the gunwales, lie down, quickly lie down!"

A dark shadow swept past overhead. Zhao Zhuang Sheng saw it clearly, reached out, and at that very moment, the surging water suddenly subsided, and then rose sharply again. The stern of the serpentine boat suddenly tilted upwards. Li Dingming and Zhao Zhuang Sheng simultaneously slipped their fingers and were thrown into the air. Basang and Master Yala, sitting behind them, reached out and firmly grabbed their ankles. Master Yala said to Zhao Zhuang Sheng, "Got you!"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng instead shouted, "Let go of me!" Master Yala sat solemnly and recited scriptures, regardless of Zhao Zhuang Sheng's struggles, unable to break free. Zhao Zhuang Sheng screamed, "Li Hong! Li Hong fell!" Yue Yang, at the bow, heard this and his heart tightened!

Li Dingming was thrown heavily back onto the boat by Basang. Then the boat swayed again. Basang said in a hoarse voice, "Grab your backpacks!"

At this moment, the serpentine boat was like a car speeding down a rocky slope, shaking up and down with the water flow. The entire process lasted for several minutes, and the turbulent waves gradually subsided. Among these people, only the veteran team members who had been to the Americas could truly appreciate the power of the turbulent waves and their irresistible force. Recalling it, it was a ceaseless bumping, as if all their bones had been shaken loose, and even their consciousness and thoughts became blurred due to the violent shaking. Only a clear point of clarity remained in their minds, controlling their fingers to hold on tightly, knowing that nothing else mattered. The current situation was the same. The hands gripping the gunwales seemed to gather all their strength, while the rest of their bodies had lost all sensation. Even though the waves had calmed, they would need to rest for a long time to regain strength in their muscles. Meng Haoran, not understanding the reason, stumbled as soon as he stood up. He knelt on the boat, gripping his backpack with both hands, only to find his arms trembling slightly. Turning to look, he saw that not only himself but also Li Dingming was trembling even more severely.

After a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, Master Tashi was the first to stand up, take a few steady steps forward, and approach Zhang Xiang, asking, "Are you okay?" He clearly saw that a huge stone pillar had scraped heavily against Zhang Xiang's back. In the chaos, that "ouch" was Zhang Xiang's cry.

Zhang Xiang's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his face was pale. He smiled and said, "I'm fine, just bumped into it. *Hiss*!" Master Tashi gently lifted Zhang Xiang's vest and saw that Zhang Xiang's back was scraped off a large piece of flesh, bleeding profusely. Tang Min, seeing this from behind, exclaimed, "Oh my!"

Master Tashi said to Tang Min, "I think we need something to stop the bleeding."

Tang Min released her grip on the gunwale, her hands trembling. She tried to open the backpack zipper several times but couldn't. Master Tashi came to help. Tang Min instructed, "The gauze is in the second pocket, followed by bandages. The disinfectant is in the third compartment on the left." Lü Jingnan also came to help.

Yue Yang clenched his fists. His limbs could move. He leaned sideways and grabbed Zhang Li, saying, "Come and take a look at this light; it seems to be damaged." Chu Yan, standing nearby, commented, "It looks like it's broken. I saw that pillar directly hit the lamp cover."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and asked Yan Yong and Captain Hu Yang, two exploration captains who hadn't experienced the tidal surge, "Are you two alright?" Both shook their heads and simultaneously looked towards the injured Zhang Xiang.

Yan Yong stated, "Alright, we've survived again." As he spoke, he tried to stand up, but his knees went weak, and he stumbled forward, grabbing Zhang Li's backpack with his hands, managing not to fall to the ground. He then realized the right side was empty and asked, "Where's Li Hong?"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng roared. As Master Yala loosened his grip, he lunged into the Styx River. Basang shouted, "Nonsense! Don't go looking for death!"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was also startled. Li Hong was right behind him. He had let go without making a sound. At that time, everyone had their heads bowed, and no one noticed Li Hong sweeping past them. Looking at the suddenly rising ten-meter-high tidal wave, if he had been washed away during the surge, there would be no finding him.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba and the others went to the stern of the boat and shone the searchlight onto the water surface, looking for Zhao Zhuang Sheng's figure. After a moment, Zhao Zhuang Sheng emerged from the dark river, angrily striking the water surface with his hands, splashing large amounts of water, and cursing, "Li Hong fell, why didn't you grab him! You're all so capable! Hmph! *Cough cough*... *Gurgle gurgle*..." He then sank again...

Yue Yang called from the stern, "Skinny, come up quickly! There are more small waves behind you; you'll be swept away!" But Zhao Zhuang Sheng didn't answer. He waved his hands in the air, seemingly not quite right.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Remember to maintain contact and be careful." Yue Yang went off happily to discuss this with Zhang Li and Basang. Zhuo Mu Qiangba then called Professor Fang Xin and informed him of this information. While traveling, Zhuo Mu Qiangba maintained daily contact with the professor, exchanging information. The closer they got to the Gate of Hell, the longer their phone calls became. He knew that after this departure, the Styx River would separate them by thousands of years, and their return date was uncertain.

The next day, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Basang, and others turned south, while Zhuo Mu Qiangba led the remaining team members north. Midway, he received a call from Yue Yang. Yue Yang said on the phone, "Young Master Qiangba, the inference has been confirmed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "What did you say! There really is a passage there?"

Yue Yang replied, "Yes, but it's not marked on the map because it's a sieve-like passage with many entrances, each only the size of a fist. We used a camera to probe it and found that the tunnels inside are equally narrow. I'll explain when I get back. In any case, this entrance is unusable."

Standing on the platform of the Gate of Hell, Meng Haoran sighed, "Flying stream straight down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way falls from nine heavens..."

Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent natural scenery, as beautiful as a fairy land in a painting, like an illusion in a dream. The silver ribbon was slightly larger than when they had last visited, its momentum increasingly majestic. Below the cliff face, the waves churned like ten thousand galloping horses, charging forward relentlessly, evoking the sentiment of "Yellow River water comes from the heavens, flowing to the sea and never returning."

Li Hong cautiously asked Master Yala, who had been there before, "Why don't I see the gate?"

Master Yala stared at the rolling waves below and replied, "It's in the water."

"Ah!" Li Hong looked down the cliff face. Whirlpools passed one after another beneath their feet. Just watching them was dizzying. Such turbulent currents, even if an iron bull fell in, would disappear without a trace!

While Meng Haoran was lost in his poetic fervor, Li Dingming seized his SLR camera and began taking pictures.

Minmin, who was also not visiting for the first time, was captivated by a beautiful butterfly on Lü Jingnan's shoulder. The butterfly's wings fluttered slowly in the sunlight, but its few feet were firmly stuck to Lü Jingnan's shoulder, not leaving even when he shook his shoulders to capture the scenery.

Tang Min curiously asked, "Brother Dingming, when did this butterfly fly here? Why isn't it leaving?"

Li Dingming looked and smiled, "I don't know why. Since childhood, I've always attracted butterflies. Every time I went on an outing, a group of butterflies followed me. My daughter is the same; all the children affectionately call her Butterfly Princess. When I came out this time, I promised her I'd bring back the most beautiful butterfly I'd never seen."

While Li Dingming and Tang Min were talking, Master Yala and Master Tashi glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, "Contracted!" Both masters had the same thought flash through their minds.

"Hey, everyone, pull yourselves together!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba encouraged them, "Listen, the second wave of water is coming soon. If you don't want to fall behind so quickly, get energized! Hold onto the boat tightly!"

"What!"

"It's coming again!"

"Oh my gosh!" The new team members cried out in unison. However, an ominous sound quickly silenced them, "Buzzing..." "Mmm... mmm..." Ripples appeared on the water surface again. Yue Yang's prediction was correct. This was a warning signal that made everyone's hearts clench.

Roaring forward and then whistling away, the silver dragon was like the sanitation crew of this underground kingdom, cleaning the cave once in a while. Its irresistible power made people tremble. This time, the surge was even greater and more rapid. The entire keel boat was tossed up from the water like a speed boat several times. The spray from the bow splashed everyone on the boat, soaking them. Everyone gripped the gunwales, their knuckles turning white. They all knew that if they let go, they would fall behind Zhuo Mu Qiangba. Behind them lay endless darkness. No one knew where the turbulent currents would carry them, nor how long they could endure within these currents. Yue Yang, holding onto the bow of the boat, watched vigilantly. The main rope, stretched taut, continuously tightened under the immense force of the water, twisting tightly into the keel, making a "creaking" sound. Yue Yang's heart tightened like the keel. He knew that if the main rope broke under such great force, it would be fortunate if the entire boat was only pushed back to the starting position. If the boat got stuck somewhere or capsized and broke, it would undoubtedly be a complete annihilation. He had made up his mind: they had to endure this wave of surging water, and next time they tied up, they should use at least two main ropes.

With a "clatter," Yue Yang's vision suddenly turned black. Light shone from behind him. It turned out that the immense impact had tossed the keel boat high up, and the searchlight at the bow collided with a hanging stalactite overhead, immediately extinguishing. Then came an "ouch," and someone cried out.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba's voice commanded, "Careful! Watch out for the stalactites overhead! Hold onto the gunwales, lie down, quickly lie down!"

A dark shadow swept past overhead. Zhao Zhuang Sheng saw it clearly, reached out, and at that very moment, the surging water suddenly subsided, and then rose sharply again. The stern of the serpentine boat suddenly tilted upwards. Li Dingming and Zhao Zhuang Sheng simultaneously slipped their fingers and were thrown into the air. Basang and Master Yala, sitting behind them, reached out and firmly grabbed their ankles. Master Yala said to Zhao Zhuang Sheng, "Got you!"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng instead shouted, "Let go of me!" Master Yala sat solemnly and recited scriptures, regardless of Zhao Zhuang Sheng's struggles, unable to break free. Zhao Zhuang Sheng screamed, "Li Hong! Li Hong fell!" Yue Yang, at the bow, heard this and his heart tightened!

Li Dingming was thrown heavily back onto the boat by Basang. Then the boat swayed again. Basang said in a hoarse voice, "Grab your backpacks!"

At this moment, the serpentine boat was like a car speeding down a rocky slope, shaking up and down with the water flow. The entire process lasted for several minutes, and the turbulent waves gradually subsided. Among these people, only the veteran team members who had been to the Americas could truly appreciate the power of the turbulent waves and their irresistible force. Recalling it, it was a ceaseless bumping, as if all their bones had been shaken loose, and even their consciousness and thoughts became blurred due to the violent shaking. Only a clear point of clarity remained in their minds, controlling their fingers to hold on tightly, knowing that nothing else mattered. The current situation was the same. The hands gripping the gunwales seemed to gather all their strength, while the rest of their bodies had lost all sensation. Even though the waves had calmed, they would need to rest for a long time to regain strength in their muscles. Meng Haoran, not understanding the reason, stumbled as soon as he stood up. He knelt on the boat, gripping his backpack with both hands, only to find his arms trembling slightly. Turning to look, he saw that not only himself but also Li Dingming was trembling even more severely.

After a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, Master Tashi was the first to stand up, take a few steady steps forward, and approach Zhang Xiang, asking, "Are you okay?" He clearly saw that a huge stone pillar had scraped heavily against Zhang Xiang's back. In the chaos, that "ouch" was Zhang Xiang's cry.

Zhang Xiang's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his face was pale. He smiled and said, "I'm fine, just bumped into it. *Hiss*!" Master Tashi gently lifted Zhang Xiang's vest and saw that Zhang Xiang's back was scraped off a large piece of flesh, bleeding profusely. Tang Min, seeing this from behind, exclaimed, "Oh my!"

Master Tashi said to Tang Min, "I think we need something to stop the bleeding."

Tang Min released her grip on the gunwale, her hands trembling. She tried to open the backpack zipper several times but couldn't. Master Tashi came to help. Tang Min instructed, "The gauze is in the second pocket, followed by bandages. The disinfectant is in the third compartment on the left." Lü Jingnan also came to help.

Yue Yang clenched his fists. His limbs could move. He leaned sideways and grabbed Zhang Li, saying, "Come and take a look at this light; it seems to be damaged." Chu Yan, standing nearby, commented, "It looks like it's broken. I saw that pillar directly hit the lamp cover."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and asked Yan Yong and Captain Hu Yang, two exploration captains who hadn't experienced the tidal surge, "Are you two alright?" Both shook their heads and simultaneously looked towards the injured Zhang Xiang.

Yan Yong stated, "Alright, we've survived again." As he spoke, he tried to stand up, but his knees went weak, and he stumbled forward, grabbing Zhang Li's backpack with his hands, managing not to fall to the ground. He then realized the right side was empty and asked, "Where's Li Hong?"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng roared. As Master Yala loosened his grip, he lunged into the Styx River. Basang shouted, "Nonsense! Don't go looking for death!"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was also startled. Li Hong was right behind him. He had let go without making a sound. At that time, everyone had their heads bowed, and no one noticed Li Hong sweeping past them. Looking at the suddenly rising ten-meter-high tidal wave, if he had been washed away during the surge, there would be no finding him.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba and the others went to the stern of the boat and shone the searchlight onto the water surface, looking for Zhao Zhuang Sheng's figure. After a moment, Zhao Zhuang Sheng emerged from the dark river, angrily striking the water surface with his hands, splashing large amounts of water, and cursing, "Li Hong fell, why didn't you grab him! You're all so capable! Hmph! *Cough cough*... *Gurgle gurgle*..." He then sank again...

Yue Yang called from the stern, "Skinny, come up quickly! There are more small waves behind you; you'll be swept away!" But Zhao Zhuang Sheng didn't answer. He waved his hands in the air, seemingly not quite right.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Remember to maintain contact and be careful." Yue Yang went off happily to discuss this with Zhang Li and Basang. Zhuo Mu Qiangba then called Professor Fang Xin and informed him of this information. While traveling, Zhuo Mu Qiangba maintained daily contact with the professor, exchanging information. The closer they got to the Gate of Hell, the longer their phone calls became. He knew that after this departure, the Styx River would separate them by thousands of years, and their return date was uncertain.

The next day, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Basang, and others turned south, while Zhuo Mu Qiangba led the remaining team members north. Midway, he received a call from Yue Yang. Yue Yang said on the phone, "Young Master Qiangba, the inference has been confirmed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "What did you say! There really is a passage there?"

Yue Yang replied, "Yes, but it's not marked on the map because it's a sieve-like passage with many entrances, each only the size of a fist. We used a camera to probe it and found that the tunnels inside are equally narrow. I'll explain when I get back. In any case, this entrance is unusable."

Standing on the platform of the Gate of Hell, Meng Haoran sighed, "Flying stream straight down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way falls from nine heavens..."

Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent natural scenery, as beautiful as a fairy land in a painting, like an illusion in a dream. The silver ribbon was slightly larger than when they had last visited, its momentum increasingly majestic. Below the cliff face, the waves churned like ten thousand galloping horses, charging forward relentlessly, evoking the sentiment of "Yellow River water comes from the heavens, flowing to the sea and never returning."

Li Hong cautiously asked Master Yala, who had been there before, "Why don't I see the gate?"

Master Yala stared at the rolling waves below and replied, "It's in the water."

"Ah!" Li Hong looked down the cliff face. Whirlpools passed one after another beneath their feet. Just watching them was dizzying. Such turbulent currents, even if an iron bull fell in, would disappear without a trace!

While Meng Haoran was lost in his poetic fervor, Li Dingming seized his SLR camera and began taking pictures.

Minmin, who was also not visiting for the first time, was captivated by a beautiful butterfly on Lü Jingnan's shoulder. The butterfly's wings fluttered slowly in the sunlight, but its few feet were firmly stuck to Lü Jingnan's shoulder, not leaving even when he shook his shoulders to capture the scenery.

Tang Min curiously asked, "Brother Dingming, when did this butterfly fly here? Why isn't it leaving?"

Li Dingming looked and smiled, "I don't know why. Since childhood, I've always attracted butterflies. Every time I went on an outing, a group of butterflies followed me. My daughter is the same; all the children affectionately call her Butterfly Princess. When I came out this time, I promised her I'd bring back the most beautiful butterfly I'd never seen."

While Li Dingming and Tang Min were talking, Master Yala and Master Tashi glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, "Contracted!" Both masters had the same thought flash through their minds.

"Father, according to what you said, is believing in religion entirely beneficial and without harm? Then what about holy wars? Is fighting for faith also a good thing? I've seen people who need faith; they do things that ordinary people wouldn't dare to do because of their fervent faith."

"Qiangbala, my child, you clearly have only a superficial, shallow understanding of religion. I don't know if this is one reason why you dislike religion. Religion is just a tool; it's not inherently wrong. No doctrine teaches people to have evil as their faith. Just like a kitchen knife, it can create delicious dishes in the hands of a chef, but it becomes a tool for bloodshed in the hands of a villain. But the kitchen knife itself exists because people need it. As for the believers you mention, I firmly believe that the mistakes they make due to faith have certain limitations. This limitation comes from their inner unease. In fact, the truly terrifying ones are those who have no faith at all. You will understand. Those who kill without any reason, their depravity stems from their loss of humanity. If a person loses their faith, then life becomes meaningless to them. They have nothing to fear, and they can even do things more terrifying than animal instincts. They stop at nothing, and no cruelty is too much for them."

"No religion teaches people how to make mistakes. Only those who make mistakes try to alleviate their sense of guilt."

"I have no faith."

"Really? Then let me ask you, do you feel guilty when you lie?"

"Of course, I do."

"When you do something, do you first consider whether it can be done?"

"No."

"Then, when you are doing this thing, do you believe you will succeed?"

"Yes."

"When you are doing this thing, do you firmly believe that if you work hard and persevere, you will definitely succeed?"

"Yes, I do! I'm sure!"

"You see, my child, this is faith."

"I have... faith?"

"Yes, except for the devil, everyone has their own faith."

"I have faith!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. He didn't understand what was happening. In this dark, enclosed, cold space, unable to bear the hunger, he had somehow fallen asleep again in a daze. The sky was as dark as ink as usual, and even the headlamp had run out of power and gone out. In the darkness, no one could see anyone else. He only knew that Minmin was leaning against his legs. It seemed he wouldn't wake up tonight. Only the gnawing pain in his abdomen reminded him that he was still hovering on the edge of hell. He asked himself, "Am I still alive?" Yes, he was still alive. Since he was still alive, he had to do something.

As soon as he moved, Minmin whispered, "You... you're awake?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Try not to talk. Just relax. It will pass. All of this."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully placed Minmin's head on the boat and struggled to turn over. At this moment, the one-meter-high gunwale of the serpentine boat seemed like an insurmountable obstacle to him. He crawled on the ground, truly lacking the strength to support his body. Moreover, what was the point of getting up? Getting up would only lead to more darkness. Darkness enveloped them, and darkness reminded them that this was the Styx River, where death was the sole ruler.

After about an hour, he was woken up by Yue Yang. "Young Master Qiangba, wake up..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. Yue Yang said, "The second wave of rising water is probably coming soon."

"What! So soon!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was startled, his sleepiness completely gone. He turned over and stood up, asking, "Are you sure?"

Yue Yang handed him the open laptop, saying, "Young Master Qiangba, look. This is another abstract symbol on the map that we haven't fully understood. Why are the marked times so abstract that even Master Yala and the others couldn't identify them? After repeated observation, I found that these symbols are not a complete animal, but a combination of two animals. Look at this one, a bull's head and a chicken's tail. And this one, a tiger's face and a monkey's body. That's why it's so difficult to understand. Then I thought of the poem from Gongbu Village, which says the warriors only rest twice a day. Why twice? If the animals representing time are not one, but two... Also, the times recorded by our observation points clearly show that the Brahmaputra River rises twice every day, just that one time is more than the other. If we restore the two parts of the animals, then it would be this time period."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What time is it?"

Yue Yang replied, "It's 5 AM."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba remarked, "I slept for so long."

Yue Yang suggested, "Young Master Qiangba, look, shouldn't we wake everyone up..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba responded, "Okay, wake everyone up. This matter cannot be overlooked."

Everyone was woken up groggily. Some complained that they had just fallen asleep, while others seemed not to have slept at all. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at them with concern.

The stern of the serpentine boat suddenly tilted upwards. Li Dingming and Zhao Zhuang Sheng simultaneously slipped their fingers and were thrown into the air. Basang and Master Yala, sitting behind them, reached out and firmly grabbed their ankles. Master Yala said to Zhao Zhuang Sheng, "Got you!"

Zhao Zhuang Sheng instead shouted, "Let go of me!" Master Yala sat solemnly and recited scriptures, regardless of Zhao Zhuang Sheng's struggles, unable to break free. Zhao Zhuang Sheng screamed, "Li Hong! Li Hong fell!" Yue Yang, at the bow, heard this and his heart tightened!

Li Dingming was thrown heavily back onto the boat by Basang. Then the boat swayed again. Basang said in a hoarse voice, "Grab your backpacks!"

At this moment, the serpentine boat was like a car speeding down a rocky slope, shaking up and down with the water flow. The entire process lasted for several minutes, and the turbulent waves gradually subsided. Among these people, only the veteran team members who had been to the Americas could truly appreciate the power of the turbulent waves and their irresistible force. Recalling it, it was a ceaseless bumping, as if all their bones had been shaken loose, and even their consciousness and thoughts became blurred due to the violent shaking. Only a clear point of clarity remained in their minds, controlling their fingers to hold on tightly, knowing that nothing else mattered. The current situation was the same. The hands gripping the gunwales seemed to gather all their strength, while the rest of their bodies had lost all sensation. Even though the waves had calmed, they would need to rest for a long time to regain strength in their muscles. Meng Haoran, not understanding the reason, stumbled as soon as he stood up. He knelt on the boat, gripping his backpack with both hands, only to find his arms trembling slightly. Turning to look, he saw that not only himself but also Li Dingming was trembling even more severely.

After a few minutes, to everyone's surprise, Master Tashi was the first to stand up, take a few steady steps forward, and approach Zhang Xiang, asking, "Are you okay?" He clearly saw that a huge stone pillar had scraped heavily against Zhang Xiang's back. In the chaos, that "ouch" was Zhang Xiang's cry.

Zhang Xiang's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his face was pale. He smiled and said, "I'm fine, just bumped into it. *Hiss*!" Master Tashi gently lifted Zhang Xiang's vest and saw that Zhang Xiang's back was scraped off a large piece of flesh, bleeding profusely. Tang Min, seeing this from behind, exclaimed, "Oh my!"

Master Tashi said to Tang Min, "I think we need something to stop the bleeding."

Tang Min released her grip on the gunwale, her hands trembling. She tried to open the backpack zipper several times but couldn't. Master Tashi came to help. Tang Min instructed, "The gauze is in the second pocket, followed by bandages. The disinfectant is in the third compartment on the left." Lü Jingnan also came to help.

Yue Yang clenched his fists. His limbs could move. He leaned sideways and grabbed Zhang Li, saying, "Come and take a look at this light; it seems to be damaged." Chu Yan, standing nearby, commented, "It looks like it's broken. I saw that pillar directly hit the lamp cover."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba stood up and asked Yan Yong and Captain Hu Yang, two exploration captains who hadn't experienced the tidal surge, "Are you two alright?" Both shook their heads and simultaneously looked towards the injured Zhang Xiang.

Yan Yong stated, "Alright, we've survived again." As he spoke, he tried to stand up, but his knees went weak, and he stumbled forward, grabbing Zhang Li's backpack with his hands, managing not to fall to the ground. He then realized the right side was empty and asked, "Where's Li Hong?"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhao Zhuang Sheng roared. As Master Yala loosened his grip, he lunged into the Styx River. Basang shouted, "Nonsense! Don't go looking for death!"

"Li Hong fell!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was also startled. Li Hong was right behind him. He had let go without making a sound. At that time, everyone had their heads bowed, and no one noticed Li Hong sweeping past them. Looking at the suddenly rising ten-meter-high tidal wave, if he had been washed away during the surge, there would be no finding him.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba and the others went to the stern of the boat and shone the searchlight onto the water surface, looking for Zhao Zhuang Sheng's figure. After a moment, Zhao Zhuang Sheng emerged from the dark river, angrily striking the water surface with his hands, splashing large amounts of water, and cursing, "Li Hong fell, why didn't you grab him! You're all so capable! Hmph! *Cough cough*... *Gurgle gurgle*..." He then sank again...

Yue Yang called from the stern, "Skinny, come up quickly! There are more small waves behind you; you'll be swept away!" But Zhao Zhuang Sheng didn't answer. He waved his hands in the air, seemingly not quite right.

Zhuo Mu Qiangba thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Remember to maintain contact and be careful." Yue Yang went off happily to discuss this with Zhang Li and Basang. Zhuo Mu Qiangba then called Professor Fang Xin and informed him of this information. While traveling, Zhuo Mu Qiangba maintained daily contact with the professor, exchanging information. The closer they got to the Gate of Hell, the longer their phone calls became. He knew that after this departure, the Styx River would separate them by thousands of years, and their return date was uncertain.

The next day, Yue Yang, Zhang Li, Basang, and others turned south, while Zhuo Mu Qiangba led the remaining team members north. Midway, he received a call from Yue Yang. Yue Yang said on the phone, "Young Master Qiangba, the inference has been confirmed."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba exclaimed, "What did you say! There really is a passage there?"

Yue Yang replied, "Yes, but it's not marked on the map because it's a sieve-like passage with many entrances, each only the size of a fist. We used a camera to probe it and found that the tunnels inside are equally narrow. I'll explain when I get back. In any case, this entrance is unusable."

Standing on the platform of the Gate of Hell, Meng Haoran sighed, "Flying stream straight down three thousand feet, as if the Milky Way falls from nine heavens..."

Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent natural scenery, as beautiful as a fairy land in a painting, like an illusion in a dream. The silver ribbon was slightly larger than when they had last visited, its momentum increasingly majestic. Below the cliff face, the waves churned like ten thousand galloping horses, charging forward relentlessly, evoking the sentiment of "Yellow River water comes from the heavens, flowing to the sea and never returning."

Li Hong cautiously asked Master Yala, who had been there before, "Why don't I see the gate?"

Master Yala stared at the rolling waves below and replied, "It's in the water."

"Ah!" Li Hong looked down the cliff face. Whirlpools passed one after another beneath their feet. Just watching them was dizzying. Such turbulent currents, even if an iron bull fell in, would disappear without a trace!

While Meng Haoran was lost in his poetic fervor, Li Dingming seized his SLR camera and began taking pictures.

Minmin, who was also not visiting for the first time, was captivated by a beautiful butterfly on Lü Jingnan's shoulder. The butterfly's wings fluttered slowly in the sunlight, but its few feet were firmly stuck to Lü Jingnan's shoulder, not leaving even when he shook his shoulders to capture the scenery.

Tang Min curiously asked, "Brother Dingming, when did this butterfly fly here? Why isn't it leaving?"

Li Dingming looked and smiled, "I don't know why. Since childhood, I've always attracted butterflies. Every time I went on an outing, a group of butterflies followed me. My daughter is the same; all the children affectionately call her Butterfly Princess. When I came out this time, I promised her I'd bring back the most beautiful butterfly I'd never seen."

While Li Dingming and Tang Min were talking, Master Yala and Master Tashi glanced at him intentionally or unintentionally, "Contracted!" Both masters had the same thought flash through their minds.

### 第五节 最后的期待

"Father, according to what you said, is believing in religion entirely beneficial and without harm? Then what about holy wars? Is fighting for faith also a good thing? I've seen people who need faith; they do things that ordinary people wouldn't dare to do because of their fervent faith."

"Qiangbala, my child, you clearly have only a superficial, shallow understanding of religion. I don't know if this is one reason why you dislike religion. Religion is just a tool; it's not inherently wrong. No doctrine teaches people to have evil as their faith. Just like a kitchen knife, it can create delicious dishes in the hands of a chef, but it becomes a tool for bloodshed in the hands of a villain. But the kitchen knife itself exists because people need it. As for the believers you mention, I firmly believe that the mistakes they make due to faith have certain limitations. This limitation comes from their inner unease. In fact, the truly terrifying ones are those who have no faith at all. You will understand. Those who kill without any reason, their depravity stems from their loss of humanity. If a person loses their faith, then life becomes meaningless to them. They have nothing to fear, and they can even do things more terrifying than animal instincts. They stop at nothing, and no cruelty is too much for them."

"No religion teaches people how to make mistakes. Only those who make mistakes try to alleviate their sense of guilt."

"I have no faith."

"Really? Then let me ask you, do you feel guilty when you lie?"

"Of course, I do."

"When you do something, do you first consider whether it can be done?"

"No."

"Then, when you are doing this thing, do you believe you will succeed?"

"Yes."

"When you are doing this thing, do you firmly believe that if you work hard and persevere, you will definitely succeed?"

"Yes, I do! I'm sure!"

"You see, my child, this is faith."

"I have... faith?"

"Yes, except for the devil, everyone has their own faith."

"I have faith!"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. He didn't understand what was happening. In this dark, enclosed, cold space, unable to bear the hunger, he had somehow fallen asleep again in a daze. The sky was as dark as ink as usual, and even the headlamp had run out of power and gone out. In the darkness, no one could see anyone else. He only knew that Minmin was leaning against his legs. It seemed he wouldn't wake up tonight. Only the gnawing pain in his abdomen reminded him that he was still hovering on the edge of hell. He asked himself, "Am I still alive?" Yes, he was still alive. Since he was still alive, he had to do something.

As soon as he moved, Minmin whispered, "You... you're awake?"

Zhuo Mu Qiangba replied, "Try not to talk. Just relax. It will pass. All of this."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba carefully placed Minmin's head on the boat and struggled to turn over. At this moment, the one-meter-high gunwale of the serpentine boat seemed like an insurmountable obstacle to him. He crawled on the ground, truly lacking the strength to support his body. Moreover, what was the point of getting up? Getting up would only lead to more darkness. Darkness enveloped them, and darkness reminded them that this was the Styx River, where death was the sole ruler.

After about an hour, he was woken up by Yue Yang. "Young Master Qiangba, wake up..." Zhuo Mu Qiangba opened his eyes. Yue Yang said, "The second wave of rising water is probably coming soon."

"What! So soon!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba was startled, his sleepiness completely gone. He turned over and stood up, asking, "Are you sure?"

Yue Yang handed him the open laptop, saying, "Young Master Qiangba, look. This is another abstract symbol on the map that we haven't fully understood. Why are the marked times so abstract that even Master Yala and the others couldn't identify them? After repeated observation, I found that these symbols are not a complete animal, but a combination of two animals. Look at this one, a bull's head and a chicken's tail. And this one, a tiger's face and a monkey's body. That's why it's so difficult to understand. Then I thought of the poem from Gongbu Village, which says the warriors only rest twice a day. Why twice? If the animals representing time are not one, but two... Also, the times recorded by our observation points clearly show that the Brahmaputra River rises twice every day, just that one time is more than the other. If we restore the two parts of the animals, then it would be this time period."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba asked, "What time is it?"

Yue Yang replied, "It's 5 AM."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba remarked, "I slept for so long."

Yue Yang suggested, "Young Master Qiangba, look, shouldn't we wake everyone up..."

Zhuo Mu Qiangba responded, "Okay, wake everyone up. This matter cannot be overlooked."

Everyone was woken up groggily. Some complained that they had just fallen asleep, while others seemed not to have slept at all. Zhuo Mu Qiangba looked at them with concern. "Hey, everyone, pull yourselves together!" Zhuo Mu Qiangba encouraged them, "Listen, the second wave of water is coming soon. If you don't want to fall behind so quickly, get energized! Hold onto the boat tightly!"

"What!"

"It's coming again!"

"Oh my gosh!" The new team members cried out in unison. However, an ominous sound quickly silenced them, "Buzzing..." "Mmm... mmm..." Ripples appeared on the water surface again. Yue Yang's prediction was correct. This was a warning signal that made everyone's hearts clench.

Roaring forward and then whistling away, the silver dragon was like the sanitation crew of this underground kingdom, cleaning the cave once in a while. Its irresistible power made people tremble. This time, the surge was even greater and more rapid. The entire
