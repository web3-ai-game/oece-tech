Now, I\u0027m working to anticipate the missing information to offer the most useful response possible.\n\n\n**Identifying Gaps and Solutions**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current thinking process involves solidifying the initial actions. I\u0027ve broken down the request, defined the user\u0027s roles, and identified the missing information. My next step involves preparing the draft response, acknowledging the incomplete prompt and requesting the user\u0027s specific setup details to move forward effectively. I am prioritizing a welcoming tone and professional guidance, with a focus on facilitating the user\u0027s detailed input.\n\n\n**Constructing a Tailored Response**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current approach involves incorporating the user\u0027s specific context into the response. I\u0027m focusing on crafting an introduction that is both warm and informative, and will address the user\u0027s roles and responsibilities. The introduction aims to showcase expertise while requesting the critical missing details regarding the user\u0027s cloud setup. I\u0027m actively working on a concise call to action, reminding the user to fill out the original template. I am also working to ensure a helpful, actionable, and welcoming approach is conveyed throughout the response.\n\n\n**Structuring the Introduction**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current thinking process involves refining the introductory paragraph. I\u0027m focusing on creating an opening that is both welcoming and establishes my expertise in the relevant areas, particularly GCP, Firebase, and cost optimization. Simultaneously, I am working on the call to action, reminding the user to provide the details within the template. This includes incorporating the GitHub Student Pack and free credit references, and streamlining the template\u0027s structure for easy user input.\n\n\n**Finalizing Response Content**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current thinking process involves polishing the content of the response. I\u0027ve drafted a compelling introduction, addressing the user directly and affirming my expertise in relevant fields. The call to action is clear, guiding the user to provide the necessary information. I\u0027m focusing on incorporating references to the GitHub Student Pack and free credits, and ensuring the response feels actionable and encourages detailed input.
